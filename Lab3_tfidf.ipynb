       "u'======== 01-01\\nWritten by: Marta Kauffman & David Crane\\nMonica: There\\'s nothing to tell! He\\'s just some guy I work with!\\nJoey: C\\'mon, you\\'re going out with the guy! There\\'s gotta be something wrong with him!\\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\\nPhoebe: Just, \\'cause, I don\\'t want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It\\'s just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\\nChandler: Alright, so I\\'m back in high school, I\\'m standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there\\'s a phone... there.\\nJoey: Instead of...?\\nChandler: That\\'s right.\\nJoey: Never had that dream.\\nPhoebe: No.\\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don\\'t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\\nMonica: And they weren\\'t looking at you before?!\\nChandler: Finally, I figure I\\'d better answer it, and it turns out it\\'s my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\\nRoss:  Hi.\\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\\nChandler: Cookie?\\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\\nJoey: Ohh.\\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\\nRoss: Thanks.\\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\\nRoss: No, no don\\'t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\\nPhoebe: Fine! Be murky!\\nRoss: I\\'ll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she\\'ll be very happy.\\nMonica: No you don\\'t.\\nRoss: No I don\\'t, to hell with her, she left me!\\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn\\'t know, how should I know?\\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I\\'ll never have grandchildren, I\\'ll never have grandchildren.\" was what? A wrong number?\\nRoss: Sorry.\\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You\\'re feeling a lot of pain right now. You\\'re angry. You\\'re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\\nJoey: Strip joint! C\\'mon, you\\'re single! Have some hormones!\\nRoss: I don\\'t want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\\nMonica: Rachel?!\\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren\\'t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\\nMonica:  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\\nRachel: Hi, sure!\\nRoss: Hi.\\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-  So anyway I just didn\\'t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\\nMonica: Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding.\\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an issue...\\nMonica: Now I\\'m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she\\'s really not happy about it.\\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad? Decide!\\nRoss:  I\\'ll have whatever Christine is having.\\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can\\'t marry him! I\\'m sorry. I just don\\'t love him. Well, it matters to me!\\nPhoebe: If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\\nRachel: C\\'mon Daddy, listen to me! It\\'s like, it\\'s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, \\'You\\'re a shoe! You\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe!\\'. And today I just stopped and I said, \\'What if I don\\'t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y\\'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I\\'m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I\\'m saying I am a ha- It\\'s a metaphor, Daddy!\\nRoss: You can see where he\\'d have trouble.\\nRachel: Look Daddy, it\\'s my life. Well maybe I\\'ll just stay here with Monica.\\nMonica: Well, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s staying here with Monica...\\nRachel: Well, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe I don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\\nPhoebe:  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...\\nRachel: I\\'m all better now.\\nPhoebe:  I helped!\\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y\\'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, \\'hat\\' thing.\\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he\\'s away a lot.\\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It\\'s her wedding day!\\nJoey: What, like there\\'s a rule or something?\\nChandler: Please don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a horrible sound.\\nPaul:  It\\'s, uh, it\\'s Paul.\\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!\\nJoey: Who\\'s Paul?\\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your \\'not a real date\\' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\\nMonica: Yes!\\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\\nRachel: Please, no, go, that\\'d be fine!\\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\\nRoss:  That\\'d be good...\\nMonica:  Really?\\nRoss:  No, go on! It\\'s Paul the Wine Guy!\\nPhoebe: What does that mean?  Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name. Paul, was it?\\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I\\'ll just--I\\'ll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\\nRoss: A wandering?\\nMonica: Change! Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can\\'t be good.\\nJoey: Hey, Paul!\\nPaul: Yeah?\\nJoey: Here\\'s a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\\nRoss: So Rachel, what\\'re you, uh... what\\'re you up to tonight?\\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\\nRoss: Right, you\\'re not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don\\'t feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\\nChandler:  Yes, and we\\'re very excited about it.\\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I\\'m just gonna hang out here tonight. It\\'s been kinda a long day.\\nRoss: Okay, sure.\\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don\\'t want to.\\nCommercial Break\\nPhoebe:  La-la-la-la...ohhh!\\nRoss:  I\\'m supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\\nJoey: I\\'m thinking we\\'ve got a bookcase here.\\nChandler: It\\'s a beautiful thing.\\nJoey:  What\\'s this?\\nChandler: I would have to say that is an \\'L\\'-shaped bracket.\\nJoey: Which goes where?\\nChandler: I have no idea.\\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\\nChandler: All finished!\\nRoss:  This was Carol\\'s favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you\\'re gonna start with that stuff we\\'re outta here.\\nChandler: Yes, please don\\'t spoil all this fun.\\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\\nRoss: You guys.\\nChandler: Oh, God.\\nJoey: You got screwed.\\nChandler: Oh my God!\\nMonica: Oh my God!\\nPaul: I know, I know, I\\'m such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?\\nMonica: My brother\\'s going through that right now, he\\'s such a mess. How did you get through it?\\nPaul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-\\nMonica: -leg?\\nPaul:  That\\'s one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.\\nMonica: You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend\\'s favorite bath towel.\\nPaul: Ooh, steer clear of you.\\nMonica: That\\'s right.\\nRachel: Barry, I\\'m sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn\\'t... it isn\\'t, it\\'s about me, and I ju-\\nRoss: I\\'m divorced! I\\'m only 26 and I\\'m divorced!\\nJoey: Shut up!\\nChandler: You must stop!\\nRoss: That only took me an hour.\\nChandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don\\'t do it! I don\\'t think that was my point!\\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if there\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\\nJoey: What are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'? That\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There\\'s lots of flavors out there. There\\'s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get \\'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!\\nRoss: I honestly don\\'t know if I\\'m hungry or horny.\\nChandler: Stay out of my freezer!\\nPaul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...\\nMonica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?\\nPaul: No, it\\'s, it\\'s more of a fifth date kinda revelation.\\nMonica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?\\nPaul: Isn\\'t there?\\nMonica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?\\nPaul: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven\\'t been able to, uh, perform.  ...Sexually.\\nMonica:  Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...\\nPaul: It\\'s okay...\\nMonica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?\\nPaul: Two years.\\nMonica: Wow! I\\'m-I\\'m-I\\'m glad you smashed her watch!\\nPaul: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?\\nMonica: ...Yeah. Yeah, I do.\\nPriest on TV: We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.\\nRachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That\\'s the difference!\\nRoss:  Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it\\'s been since I\\'ve grabbed a spoon? Do the words \\'Billy, don\\'t be a hero\\' mean anything to you?\\nJoey: Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,\\nChandler: Angela\\'s the screamer, Andrea has cats.\\nJoey: Right. Thanks. It\\'s June. I\\'m outta here.\\nRoss: Y\\'know, here\\'s the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: Isn\\'t this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.\\nChandler: That is amazing.\\nJoey: Congratulations.\\nRachel: Y\\'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.\\nChandler: If can invade Poland, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.\\nJoey: Listen, while you\\'re on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I\\'m really not that hungry...\\nMonica:  Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.\\nAll: Morning. Good morning.\\nPaul:  Morning.\\nJoey: Morning, Paul.\\nRachel: Hello, Paul.\\nChandler: Hi, Paul, is it?\\nPaul: Thank you! Thank you so much!\\nMonica: Stop!\\nPaul: No, I\\'m telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.\\nMonica: We\\'ll talk later.\\nPaul: Yeah.\\nJoey: That wasn\\'t a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?\\nMonica: Shut up, and put my table back.\\nAll: Okayyy!\\nChandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don\\'t input those numbers,... it doesn\\'t make much of a difference...\\nRachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?\\nMonica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that\\'s how we buy stuff.\\nJoey: Yeah, I\\'m an actor.\\nRachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?\\nJoey: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.\\nMonica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns\\' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.\\nJoey: Look, it was a job all right?\\nChandler: \\'Look, Gippetto, I\\'m a real live boy.\\'\\nJoey: I will not take this abuse.\\nChandler: You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry.  \"Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...\"\\nJoey: You should both know, that he\\'s a dead man. Oh, Chandler?\\nMonica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can\\'t stop smiling.\\nRachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.\\nMonica: I know, he\\'s just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?\\nRachel: Oh, yeah.\\nMonica: Well, it\\'s like that. With feelings.\\nRachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.\\nMonica: Big time!\\nRachel: Want a wedding dress?  Hardly used.\\nMonica: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I\\'m just gonna get up and go to work.\\nRachel: Oh, look, wish me luck!\\nMonica: What for?\\nRachel: I\\'m gonna go get one of those  job things.\\nFrannie: Hey, Monica!\\nMonica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?\\nFrannie: You had sex, didn\\'t you?\\nMonica: How do you do that?\\nFrannie: Oh, I hate you, I\\'m pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you\\'re having sex! So? Who?\\nMonica: You know Paul?\\nFrannie: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.\\nMonica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?\\nFrannie: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y\\'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.\\nJoey: Of course it was a line!\\nMonica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\\nRoss: I assume we\\'re looking for an answer more sophisticated than \\'to get you into bed\\'.\\nMonica: I hate men! I hate men!\\nPhoebe: Oh no, don\\'t hate, you don\\'t want to put that out into the universe.\\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\\nPhoebe: All right, c\\'mere, gimme your feet.\\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y\\'know?\\nJoey:  I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t know it was a line!\\nRachel: Guess what?\\nRoss: You got a job?\\nRachel: Are you kidding? I\\'m trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\\nChandler: And yet you\\'re surprisingly upbeat.\\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\\nRachel: They\\'re my new \\'I don\\'t need a job, I don\\'t need my parents, I\\'ve got great boots\\' boots!\\nMonica: How\\'d you pay for them?\\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\\nMonica: And who pays for that?\\nRachel: Um... my... father.\\nRachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\\nMonica: C\\'mon, you can\\'t live off your parents your whole life.\\nRachel: I know that. That\\'s why I was getting married.\\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it\\'s hard being on your own for the first time.\\nRachel: Thank you.\\nPhoebe: You\\'re welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn\\'t know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\\nRoss: The word you\\'re looking for is \\'Anyway\\'...\\nMonica: All right, you ready?\\nRachel: No. No, no, I\\'m not ready! How can I be ready? \"Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\" Come on, I can\\'t do this!\\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\\nRachel: I don\\'t think so.\\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!  You can do anything!\\nRoss: C\\'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\\nRachel: Y\\'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It\\'s kinda like a symbolic gesture...\\nMonica: Rachel! That was a library card!\\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\\nChandler:  Y\\'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You\\'re gonna love it!\\nMonica: Well, that\\'s it  You gonna crash on the couch?\\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\\nMonica: You be okay?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\\nMonica: That\\'s Paul\\'s watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\\nRachel: Sorry-\\nRoss: No no no, go-\\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don\\'t want it-\\nRoss: Split it?\\nRachel: Okay.\\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn\\'t know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\\nRachel: I knew.\\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica\\'s geeky older brother.\\nRachel: I did.\\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\\nRachel: Goodnight.\\nRoss: Goodnight.\\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what\\'s with you?\\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon.\\nClosing Credits\\nJoey: I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here.\\nPhoebe:  I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here...\\nMonica: What? I-I said you had a-\\nPhoebe:  What I said you had...\\nMonica:  Would you stop?\\nPhoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?\\nAll: Yes!\\nMonica: I said that you had a nice butt, it\\'s just not a great butt.\\nJoey: Oh, you wouldn\\'t know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.\\nRoss: There\\'s an image.\\nRachel:  Would anybody like more coffee?\\nChandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?\\nRachel: I\\'m just serving it.\\nAll: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'ll have a cup of coffee.\\nChandler: Kids, new dream... I\\'m in Las Vegas.\\nCustomer:  Ahh, miss?  More coffee?\\nRachel: Ugh.  Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.\\nChandler: Okay, so, I\\'m in Las Vegas... I\\'m Liza Minelli-\\nEnd\\n======== 01-02\\nWritten by: Marta Kauffman & David Crane\\nMonica: What you guys don\\'t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\\nJoey: Yeah, right!.......Y\\'serious?\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\\nRachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\\nMonica: Absolutely.\\nChandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y\\'know? I mean it\\'s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\\nRoss: Yeah, and-and it\\'s not that we don\\'t like the comedian, it\\'s that-that... that\\'s not why we bought the ticket.\\nChandler: The problem is, though, after the concert\\'s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y\\'know? I mean, we\\'re in the car, we\\'re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\\nRachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you\\'re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\\nJoey: ....Are we still talking about sex?\\nOpening Credits\\nRoss: No, it\\'s good, it is good, it\\'s just that- mm- doesn\\'t she seem a little angry?\\nMarsha: Well, she has issues.\\nRoss: Does she.\\nMarsha: He\\'s out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\\nRoss: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like \\'Gee, that glacier\\'s getting kinda close.\\' See?\\nMarsha: Speaking of issues, isn\\'t that your ex-wife?\\nRoss:  No. No.\\nMarsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!\\nRoss: Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I\\'ll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.\\nRoss:Hi.\\nCarol: So.\\nRoss: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.\\nCarol: Sorry. You look good too.\\nRoss: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what\\'s new? Still, uh...\\nCarol: A lesbian?\\nRoss: Well... you never know. How\\'s, um.. how\\'s the family?\\nCarol: Marty\\'s still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-\\nRoss: Why- why are you here, Carol?\\nCarol: I\\'m pregnant.\\nRoss: Pregnant?!\\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three\\'s Company where there\\'s some kind of misunderstanding.\\nPhoebe:...Then I\\'ve already seen this one!\\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn\\'t need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\\nPhoebe: She\\'s already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you\\'ve already fluffed that-  -but, it\\'s fine!\\nMonica: Look , I\\'m sorry, guys, I just don\\'t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child\\'s pillow.\\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you\\'re scaring me. I mean, you\\'re like, you\\'re like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don\\'t see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\\nMonica: That\\'s because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y\\'see, he\\'s the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\\nAll: Eeaagh!\\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, it\\'s beautiful.\\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\\nPhoebe: No, look, don\\'t touch that!\\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn\\'t dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... \\'Hi Barry! Remember me? I\\'m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!\\' Oh God and now I\\'m gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\\nMonica: Easy Rach, we\\'ll find it.  Won\\'t we!\\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\\nJoey: Alright, when\\'d\\'ya have it on last?\\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\\nChandler: You don\\'t get a lot of \\'doy\\' these days...\\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\\nChandler: ...Dinah?\\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don\\'t be mad...\\nMonica: You didn\\'t.\\nRachel: Oh, I am sorry...\\nMonica: I gave you one job!\\nRachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\\nChandler: Now, Monica, you know that\\'s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\\nMonica:  I just... can\\'t do it.\\nChandler: Boys? We\\'re going in.\\nRoss: .....Hi.\\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\\nRoss: Carol\\'s pregnant.\\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I\\'m not comfortable with it, I don\\'t have to be involved.. basically it\\'s entirely up to me.\\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\\nMonica: What does she mean by \\'involved\\'?\\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\\nRachel: So what are you gonna do?\\nRoss: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I\\'m still gonna be a father.\\nJoey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin\\'s daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What\\'s that curry taste?\\nMonica: Curry.\\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\\nRoss: I- I think they\\'re great! I, I really do.\\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn\\'t she?\\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don\\'t know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\\nMonica: No Mom, I don\\'t have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don\\'t have to know that...\\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we\\'re having spaghetti! That\\'s.... easy.\\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\\nMr. Geller: I\\'m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\\nMonica: What\\'s that supposed to mean?\\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It\\'s an expression.\\nMonica: No it\\'s not.\\nMr. Geller: Don\\'t listen to your mother. You\\'re independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I\\'m telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God \\'Our Little Harmonica\\' doesn\\'t seem to have that problem.\\nMonica:  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\\nRoss:  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here\\'s the deal. Carol\\'s a lesbian. She\\'s living with a woman named Susan. She\\'s pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\\nMrs. Geller:  And you knew about this?!\\nCommercial Break\\nJoey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?\\nRoss: Well, y\\'know, these people are pros. They know what they\\'re doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\\nMonica: Boy, I know they say you can\\'t change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I\\'d want yours.\\nRoss: Must pee.\\nPhoebe: Y\\'know, it\\'s even worse when you\\'re twins.\\nRachel: You\\'re twins?\\nPhoebe: Yeah. We don\\'t speak. She\\'s like this high-powered, driven career type.\\nChandler: What does she do?\\nPhoebe: She\\'s a waitress.\\nRachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.\\nMonica: Chandler, you\\'re an only child, right? You don\\'t have any of this.\\nChandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\\nRachel: The lights, please..\\nRoss: ...How long was I in there?\\nRachel: I\\'m just cleaning up.\\nRoss: D\\'ya.. uh.. d\\'ya need any help?\\nRachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!\\nRoss: Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\\nRachel: Oh.. a little..\\nRoss: Mm-hmm..\\nRachel: A lot.\\nRoss: Mm.\\nRachel: So, got any advice? Y\\'know, as someone who\\'s recently been- dumped?\\nRoss: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word \\'dumped\\'. Chances are he\\'s gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y\\'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it\\'ll be hard. Or, y\\'know, uh, hey!, I\\'ll go down there, and I\\'ll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\\nRachel: Oh, you\\'ve got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\\nRoss: Got me.\\nRachel: Remember when we were in high school together?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nRachel: I mean, didn\\'t you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that\\'d be it?  ..Ross?\\nRoss: Yes, yes!\\nRachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I\\'d be here..\\nRoss: Me either...\\nRoss:  Sorry I\\'m late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.\\nSusan: Hi.\\nCarol: Ross, you remember Susan.\\nRoss: How could I forget?\\nSusan: Ross.\\nRoss:  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we\\'re just waiting for...?\\nCarol: Dr. Oberman.\\nRoss: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-\\nSusan: She.\\nRoss: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?\\nCarol: Yes, and she\\'s very supportive.\\nRoss: Okay, that\\'s great.  No, I\\'m- Oh.\\nCarol: Thanks.\\nRoss:  Quack, quack..\\nCarol: Ross? That opens my cervix.\\nRachel: Barry?\\nBarry: C\\'mon in.\\nRachel:  Are you sure?\\nBarry: Yeah! It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Robbie\\'s gonna be here for hours.\\nRobbie: Huh?!\\nBarry: So, how ya doin?\\nRachel: I\\'m- uh- I\\'m okay... You look great!\\nBarry: Yeah, well..\\nBernice:  Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein\\'s gagging.\\nBarry:  Be back in a sec.\\nRachel: I dumped him.\\nRobbie: Okay.\\nRoss: So, um- so how\\'s this, uh, how\\'s this gonna work? Y\\'know, with us? Y\\'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?\\nCarol: Give me a \\'for instance\\'.\\nRoss: Well, uh, uh, I don\\'t know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby\\'s name?\\nCarol: Marlon-\\nRoss: Marlon?!\\nCarol: -if it\\'s a boy, Minnie if it\\'s a girl.\\nRoss: ...As in Mouse?\\nCarol: As in my grandmother.\\nRoss: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?\\nCarol: Julia..\\nSusan: We agreed on Minnie.\\nRoss: \\'S\\'funny, um, uh, we agreed we\\'d spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia\\'s on the table..?\\nBarry: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?\\nRachel: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.\\nBarry: Oh, that\\'s great.\\nRachel: Why are- why are you so tanned?\\nBarry: Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.\\nRachel: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?\\nBarry: No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.\\nRobbie: Me?!\\nBarry: No!  I went with Mindy.\\nRachel: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!\\nBarry: Yeah, well, uh, we\\'re kind of a thing now.\\nRachel: Oh! Well, um..  You\\'ve got plugs!\\nBarry: Careful! They haven\\'t quite taken yet.\\nRachel: And you\\'ve got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!\\nBarry: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.\\nRachel: Okay..\\nBarry: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I\\'ve ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I\\'m an orthodontist.\\nRachel: Wow.\\nBarry: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren\\'t happy. But with Mindy, now I\\'m happy. Spit.\\nRachel: What?\\nRobbie: Me.\\nRachel: Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.\\nBarry: Well, thank you for giving it back.\\nRobbie: Hello?!\\nSusan: Oh, please! What\\'s wrong with Helen?\\nRoss: Helen Geller? I don\\'t think so.\\nCarol: Hello? It\\'s not gonna be Helen Geller.\\nRoss: Thank you!\\nCarol: No, I mean it\\'s not Geller.\\nRoss: What, it\\'s gonna be Helen Willick?\\nCarol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.\\nRoss: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?\\nSusan: It\\'s my baby too.\\nRoss: Oh, \\'s\\'funny, really? Um, I don\\'t remember you making any sperm.\\nSusan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!\\nCarol: All right, you two, stop it!\\nRoss: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I\\'m in there too.\\nCarol: Ross. You\\'re not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? \\'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.\\nRoss: Of course not, I\\'m... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.\\nSusan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he\\'s doing? He knows no-one\\'s gonna say all those names, so they\\'ll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!\\nRoss: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y\\'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I\\'m not, I can\\'t do-\\nDr. Oberman:  Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?\\nAll: Yeah. Yeah. A little.\\nDr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back..\\nRoss: You- uh- y\\'know what, I\\'m gonna go. I don\\'t- I don\\'t think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.\\nRoss: Oh my God.\\nSusan: Look at that.\\nCarol: I know.\\nClosing Credits\\nRoss: Well? Isn\\'t that amazing?\\nJoey: What are we supposed to be seeing here?\\nChandler: I dunno, but.. I think it\\'s about to attack the Enterprise.\\nPhoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.\\nRoss: Then don\\'t do that, alright?\\nPhoebe: Okay!\\nRoss: Monica. Whaddya think?\\nMonica:  Mm-hmm.\\nRoss: Wh- are you welling up?\\nMonica: No.\\nRoss: You are, you\\'re welling up.\\nMonica: Am not!\\nRoss: You\\'re gonna be an aunt.\\nMonica:  Oh shut up!\\nRachel:  Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-03\\nPhoebe:  Hi guys!\\nAll: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!\\nRoss: Hey. Oh, oh, how\\'d it go?\\nPhoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said \\'We should do this again!\\'\\nAll: Ohh. Ouch.\\nRachel: What? He said \\'we should do it again\\', that\\'s good, right?\\nMonica: Uh, no. Loosely translated \\'We should do this again\\' means \\'You will never see me naked\\'.\\nRachel: Since when?\\nJoey: Since always. It\\'s like dating language. Y\\'know, like \\'It\\'s not you\\' means \\'It is you\\'.\\nChandler: Or \\'You\\'re such a nice guy\\' means \\'I\\'m gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you\\'.\\nPhoebe: Or, or, y\\'know, um, \\'I think we should see other people\\' means \\'Ha, ha, I already am\\'.\\nRachel: And everybody knows this?\\nJoey: Yeah. Cushions the blow.\\nChandler: Yeah, it\\'s like when you\\'re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.\\nRoss: That\\'s funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.\\nMonica: Uh, Ross.\\nRoss: What? Wh- hello? The Millners\\' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!\\nOpening Credits\\nChandler: \"So how does it feel knowing you\\'re about to die?\"\\nJoey: \"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you\\'ll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.\"\\nChandler: Hey, that was really good!\\nJoey: Thanks! Let\\'s keep going.\\nChandler: Okay. \"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?\"\\nJoey: \"I just wanna go back to my cell. \\'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.\"\\nChandler: \"Smoke away.\"\\nChandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.\\nJoey: What?\\nChandler: Relax your hand!\\nChandler: Not so much!\\nJoey: Whoah!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Alright, now try taking a puff.\\nChandler: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.\\nJoey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.\\nChandler: It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.\\nChandler: Don\\'t think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that\\'s been missing from your hand. When you\\'re holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.\\nJoey: Y\\'miss it?\\nChandler: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.\\nMonica: No, no, no. They say it\\'s the same as the distance from the tip of a guy\\'s thumb to the tip of his index finger.\\nJoey: That\\'s ridiculous!\\nRoss: Can I use.. either thumb?\\nRachel:  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I\\'m getting pretty good at this!\\nAll: Yeah. Yeah, excellent.\\nRachel:  Good for me!\\nJoey: Y\\'okay, Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Yeah- no- I\\'m just- it\\'s, I haven\\'t worked- It\\'s my bank.\\nMonica: What did they do to you?\\nPhoebe: It\\'s nothing, it\\'s just- Okay. I\\'m going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-\\nRoss: Easy.\\nPhoebe: - and there\\'s five hundred extra dollars in my account.\\nChandler: Oh, Satan\\'s minions at work again...\\nPhoebe: Yes, \\'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.\\nJoey: What are you talking about? Keep it!\\nPhoebe: It\\'s not mine, I didn\\'t earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.\\nRachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!\\nPhoebe: Okay. Okay, let\\'s say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I\\'d hear, with every step I took? \\'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.\\' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- \\'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine\\'...\\nMonica: We\\'re with you. We got it.\\nPhoebe: Okay. I\\'d- just- I\\'d never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.\\nRachel: Chandler, what are you doing?\\nMonica:  Hey. Whaddya doing?\\nAll: Oh! Oh, God!\\nRoss: What is this?!\\nChandler: I\\'m smoking. I\\'m smoking, I\\'m smoking.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I can\\'t believe you! You\\'ve been so good, for three years!\\nChandler: And this- is my reward!\\nRoss: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.\\nChandler: Okay, so this time I won\\'t quit!\\nAll: Ohhh! Put it out!\\nChandler: All right! I\\'m putting it out, I\\'m putting it out.\\nPhoebe: Oh, no! I- I can\\'t drink this now!\\nMonica: Alright. I\\'m gonna go change, I\\'ve got a date.\\nRachel: This Alan again? How\\'s it goin\\'?\\nMonica: \\'S\\'going pretty good, y\\'know? It\\'s nice, and, we\\'re having fun.\\nJoey: So when do we get to meet the guy?\\nMonica: Let\\'s see, today\\'s Monday... Never.\\nAll: Oh, come on! Come on!\\nMonica: No. Not after what happened with Steve.\\nChandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.\\nMonica: Look, I don\\'t even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.\\nRachel: Well, then can we meet him?\\nMonica: Nope. Schhorry.\\nMonica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they\\'re all over him. I mean, they\\'re like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.\\nPaula: Listen. As someone who\\'s seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I\\'ll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they\\'re your friends, they\\'re just looking out after you.\\nMonica: I know. I just wish that once, I\\'d bring a guy home that they actually liked.\\nPaula: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..\\nJoey: Let it go, Ross.\\nRoss: Yeah, well, you didn\\'t know Chi Chi.\\nMonica: Do you all promise?\\nAll: Yeah! We promise! We\\'ll be good!\\nMonica:  Chandler? Do you promise to be good?\\nJoey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!\\nRoss: Hey, Pheebs.\\nPhoebe: \\'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We\\'re sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you\\'ll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.\\' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!\\nRachel: What bank is this?\\nMonica: Hey. It\\'s him.  Who is it?\\nAlan:  It\\'s Alan.\\nJoey:  Chandler! He\\'s here!\\nMonica:  Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.\\nMonica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.\\nAlan: Hi.\\nAll: Hi, Alan.\\nAlan: I\\'ve heard schho much about all you guyschh!\\nMonica:  Okay. Okay, let\\'s let the Alan-bashing begin. Who\\'s gonna take the first shot, hmm?\\nMonica: C\\'mon!\\nRoss: ...I\\'ll go. Let\\'s start with the way he kept picking at- no, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t do this, can\\'t do this. We loved him.\\nAll: Loved him! Yeah! He\\'s great!\\nMonica: Wait a minute! We\\'re talking about someone that I\\'m going out with?\\nAll: Yeah!\\nRachel: And did you notice...?\\nThe Guys:  Yeah.\\nJoey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.\\nPhoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!\\nRoss: ...What shoe?\\nPhoebe: From the nursery rhyme. \\'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...\\'\\nRoss: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.\\nRachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y\\'know, it.\\nMonica: Really!\\nChandler: Oh, yeah. I\\'d marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I\\'m gonna be doing that at parties, right?\\nRoss: You know what I like most about him, though?\\nAll: What?\\nRoss: The way he makes me feel about myself.\\nAll: Yeah...\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: Hi.. how was the game?\\nRoss: Well..\\nAll: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!\\nMonica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?\\nJoey: Alan.\\nRoss: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...\\nRachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.\\nChandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..\\nMonica: Can I ask you guys a question? D\\'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..\\nRoss: What?\\nMonica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?\\nRachel: Well, no. That\\'s impossible. You can never be too Alan.\\nRoss: Yeah, it\\'s his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.\\nChandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.\\nPhoebe: Hey, Lizzie.\\nLizzie: Hey, Weird Girl.\\nPhoebe: I brought you alphabet soup.\\nLizzie: Did you pick out the vowels?\\nPhoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. \\'Cause, y\\'know, \"sometimes y\". Uh, I also have something else for you.\\nLizzie: Saltines?\\nPhoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?\\nLizzie: What?  Oh my God, there\\'s really money in here.\\nPhoebe: I know.\\nLizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing?\\nPhoebe: No, I want you to have it. I don\\'t want it.\\nLizzie: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.\\nPhoebe: Oh, that\\'s fine, no.\\nLizzie: Would you like my tin-foil hat?\\nPhoebe: No. \\'Cause you need that. No, it\\'s okay, thanks.\\nLizzie: Please, let me do something.\\nPhoebe: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we\\'re even. Okay?\\nLizzie: Okay.\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nLizzie: Keep the change.  Sure you don\\'t wanna pretzel?\\nPhoebe: No, I\\'m fine.\\nLizzie:  See ya.\\nPhoebe: Huh!\\nRoss: A thumb?!\\nAll: Eww!\\nPhoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!\\nChandler: Well, maybe it\\'s a contest, y\\'know? Like, collect all five?\\nPhoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see?\\nAll: Nooo!\\nAll: Oh, hey, don\\'t do that! Cut it out!\\nRachel: It\\'s worse than the thumb!\\nChandler: Hey, this is so unfair!\\nMonica: Oh, why is it unfair?\\nChandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey\\'s constant knuckle-cracking isn\\'t annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can\\'t you accept me for this?\\nJoey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?\\nRachel: Well, I-I could live without it.\\nJoey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?\\nRoss: Oh, now, don\\'t listen to him, Pheebs, I think it\\'s endearing.\\nJoey: Oh,  \"you do, do you\"?\\nRoss: You know, there\\'s nothing wrong with speaking correctly.\\nRachel: \"Indeed there isn\\'t\"... I should really get back to work.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, \\'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.\\nRachel: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.\\nMonica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?\\nPaula: No.\\nMonica: Okay.. Well, I\\'m going out with a guy my friends all really like.\\nPaula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!\\nMonica: Can you believe it? ...Y\\'know what? I just don\\'t feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don\\'t feel the thing.\\nPaula: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that\\'s how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!\\nMonica: I know.. it\\'s gonna be really hard.\\nPaula: Well, he\\'s a big boy, he\\'ll get over it.\\nMonica: No, he\\'ll be fine. It\\'s the other five I\\'m worried about.\\nJoey: Do you have any respect for your body?\\nRoss: Don\\'t you realise what you\\'re-you\\'re doing to yourself?\\nChandler: Hey, y\\'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.\\nRachel:  Chandler? It\\'s Alan, he wants to speak to you.\\nChandler: Really? He does?\\nRachel:  God, he\\'s good.\\nRoss: If only he were a woman.\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nChandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it\\'d be talking too.\\nRoss: Okay. I think it\\'s time to change somebody\\'s nicotine patch.\\nMonica:  Hey. Where\\'s Joey?\\nChandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?\\nRachel: I think he\\'s across the hall.\\nMonica: Thanks.\\nRoss:  There y\\'go.\\nChandler:  Ooh, I\\'m alive with pleasure now.\\nRoss: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?\\nPhoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?\\nRoss: Hey, I might!\\nPhoebe: Sorry. ..Y\\'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.\\nAll: You\\'re kidding. Oh my God.\\nPhoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!\\nJoey:  What\\'s going on?\\nMonica: Nothing. I just think it\\'s nice when we\\'re all here together.\\nJoey: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..\\nRachel: Uh, Joey..\\nJoey: Oh, God!\\nMonica:  Okay..\\nAll: Oh! That was Lambchop!\\nMonica: Please, guys, we have to talk.\\nPhoebe: Wait, wait, I\\'m getting a deja vu...no, I\\'m not.\\nMonica: Alright, we have to talk.\\nPhoebe: There it is!\\nMonica: Okay. It\\'s-it\\'s about Alan. There\\'s something that you should know. I mean, there\\'s really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I\\'ve decided to break up with Alan.\\nRoss: Is there somebody else?\\nMonica: No, nononono.. it\\'s just.. things change. People change.\\nRachel: We didn\\'t change..\\nJoey: So that\\'s it? It\\'s over? Just like that?\\nPhoebe: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-\\nMonica: Look, I- I could go on pretending-\\nJoey: Okay!\\nMonica: -but that wouldn\\'t be fair to me, it wouldn\\'t be fair to Alan- It wouldn\\'t be fair to you!\\nRoss: Who-who wants fair? Y\\'know, I just want things back. Y\\'know, the way they were.\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry..\\nChandler:  Oh, she\\'s sorry! I feel better!\\nRachel:  I just can\\'t believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-\\nMonica: I\\'ll meet somone else. There\\'ll be other Alans.\\nAll: Oh, yeah! Right!\\nMonica: Are you guys gonna be okay?\\nRoss: Hey hey, we\\'ll be fine. We\\'re just gonna need a little time.\\nMonica:  I understand.\\nAlan: Wow.\\nMonica: I\\'m, I\\'m really sorry.\\nAlan: Yeah, I\\'m sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.\\nMonica: Relieved?\\nAlan: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can\\'t stand your friends.\\nClosing Credits\\nRachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.\\nRoss: Yeah. He could row like a viking.\\nMonica:  Hi.\\nAll: Mmm.\\nRoss: So how\\'d it go?\\nMonica: Oh, y\\'know..\\nPhoebe: Did he mention us?\\nMonica: He said he\\'s really gonna miss you guys.\\nRoss: You had a rough day, huh.. c\\'mere.\\nChandler: ...That\\'s it. I\\'m getting cigarettes.\\nAll: No no no!\\nChandler:  I don\\'t care, I don\\'t care! Game\\'s over! I\\'m weak! I\\'ve gotta smoke! I\\'ve gotta have the smoke!\\nPhoebe:  If you never smoke again I\\'ll give you seven thousand dollars!\\nChandler:  Yeah, alright.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-04\\nMonica: Alright. Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!\\nRoss: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?\\nChandler: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I\\'d.. make myself omnipotent forever.\\nRachel: See, there\\'s always one guy.\\nAll: Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.\\nMonica: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?\\nJoey: Probably kill myself!\\nMonica: ..Excuse me?\\nJoey: Hey, if Little Joey\\'s dead, then I got no reason to live!\\nRoss: Joey, uh- OMnipotent.\\nJoey: You are? Ross, I\\'m sorry..\\nOpening Credits\\nMonica: How does she do that?\\nRoss: I cannot sleep in a public place.\\nMonica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.\\nPhoebe:  Oh! What what what! ...Hi.\\nRoss: It\\'s okay, y\\'know, you just nodded off again.\\nMonica: What\\'s going on with you?\\nPhoebe: I got no sleep last night!\\nRoss: Why?\\nPhoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they\\'re both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they\\'re constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they\\'re having a good time.

I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.\\nLeslie: Well. Your mom didn\\'t tell us about the blobbies.\\nMonica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?\\nRachel: What\\'s that?\\nMonica: Weeeell, it\\'s rum, and-\\nRachel: Okay.\\nMonica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we\\'d have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...\\nPhoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can\\'t operate. But we can prep the guy!\\nMonica: Uh, Rach, it\\'s the Visa card people.\\nRachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want.\\nMonica:  Um, they say there\\'s been some unusual activity on your account.\\nRachel: But I haven\\'t used my card in weeks!\\nMonica: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you\\'re okay.\\nRachel: They wanna know if I\\'m okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I\\'m okay, okay, let\\'s see. Well, let\\'s see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I\\'m getting coffee! And it\\'s not even for me! So if that sounds like I\\'m okay, okay, then you can tell them I\\'m okay, okay?\\nMonica:  Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?\\nRachel: Alright, c\\'mon!  Let\\'s play Twister!\\nRoss:  Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.\\nChandler: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats?

It was the first frost...\\nJoey: C\\'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.\\nMonica: You should feel great about yourself! You\\'re doing this amazing independence thing!\\nRachel: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?\\nPhoebe: You are just like Jack.\\nRachel: ...Jack from downstairs?\\nPhoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.\\nMonica: Ah, the other Jack.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..\\nRachel: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn\\'t love him-\\nPhoebe: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.\\nRachel: But see, it was a plan. Y\\'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything\\'s just kinda like...\\nPhoebe: Floopy?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nMonica: So what, you\\'re not the only one. I mean, half the time we don\\'t know where we\\'re going. You\\'ve just gotta figure at some point it\\'s all gonna come together, and it\\'s just gonna be... un-floopy.\\nPhoebe: Oh, like that\\'s a word.\\nRachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn\\'t come together?\\nMonica: ...Pheebs?\\nPhoebe: Oh, well... \\'cause.... you just... I don\\'t like this question.\\nRachel: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don\\'t get magic beans? I mean, what if all we\\'ve got are.. beans?\\nRoss: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!\\nChandler:  See buddy, that\\'s all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.\\nRoss: Pass it! Pass it!\\nChandler: He\\'s open!\\nAll: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!\\nChandler: Hey, look, we\\'re on that TV thing!\\nCommercial Break\\nChandler: \\'Scuse me.\\nReceptionist:  It says to call this number if you\\'re not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I\\'m not completely satisfied.\\nChandler: Listen, it\\'s kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we\\'d be in the predicament room.\\nReceptionist:\\nRoss:  Look, I don\\'t wanna make any trouble, okay, but I\\'m in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.\\nReceptionist: Well, you\\'ll have to wait your turn.\\nJoey: Well, how long do you think it\\'ll be?\\nReceptionist:  Any minute now.\\nRoss: Hey, this-  Heyy...\\nRachel: I\\'m so sorry, you guys. I didn\\'t mean to bring you down.\\nMonica: No, you were right. I don\\'t have a plan.\\nPizza Guy:  Pizza guy!\\nRachel: Thank God.

I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who\\'s he sleeping with?  Ba-!\\nMonica: Light still out?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nMonica: Oh. Maybe they\\'re- napping.\\nRachel: Oh please, they\\'re having sex.\\nMonica and Phoebe: Shut up!\\nRachel: So, whaddya think George is like?\\nMonica: I think he\\'s shy.\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nMonica: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he\\'s a preppy animal.\\nRoss: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.\\nChandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?\\nJoey: He\\'s right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.\\nRoss: Look, it\\'s just a little more complicated...\\nChandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?\\nRoss: Little louder, okay, I think there\\'s a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn\\'t quite hear you...\\nChandler: Then what?\\nRoss: My first time with Carol was...\\nJoey: What?\\nRoss: It was my first time.\\nJoey: With Carol?  Oh.\\nChandler: So in your whole life, you\\'ve only been with oneoh.\\nJoey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could\\'ve done tonight!\\nMonica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh.\\nMonica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!\\nPhoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don\\'t feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.\\nMonica: What?! You slept with Jason?\\nPhoebe: You\\'d already broken up.\\nRachel: How long?\\nPhoebe: A couple hours.\\nMonica: Oh, that\\'s nice!\\nRachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one!  Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.\\nMonica: Excuse me?!\\nRachel: Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one?  She was a big girl.\\nMonica: Really. Well, at least \\'big girls\\' don\\'t pee in their pants in seventh grade!\\nRachel: I was laughing! You made me laugh!\\nPhoebe: There he is! There he is!\\nMonica: Where?\\nPhoebe: Right- where we\\'ve been looking all night!\\nRachel: He is so cute!\\nMonica: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!\\nAll: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww.\\nJoey: Man. Can you believe he\\'s only had sex with one woman?\\nChandler: I think it\\'s great. Y\\'know, it\\'s sweet, it\\'s romantic...\\nJoey: Really?\\nChandler: No, you kidding? The guy\\'s a freak..\\nBoth: Hey, buddy.\\nRoss: Hi.\\nReceptionist:  Oh, that\\'s attractive.\\nChandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.\\nRoss: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where\\'s my puck?\\nJoey: Oh, ah- the kid has it.\\nRoss: The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that\\'s, that\\'s my puck.\\nKid: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.\\nChandler: You gotta do it, man.\\nRoss:  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.\\nKid: No.\\nRoss: \\'Yes\\', how about. C\\'mere. Gimme!\\nKid: No! No!\\nReceptionist: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!\\nRoss:\\nRoss: ...Now that was fun.\\nClosing Credits\\nRoss:  Okay, Monica: Right foot red.\\nMonica: Could\\'ve played Monopoly, but nooooo.\\nChandler: Thanks.\\nRoss: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue.\\nChandler: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it\\'s the Visa card people.\\nRachel: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?\\nChandler: Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.\\nRachel: Nooo!  Oh, well, thanks, but, I\\'m okay, really.\\nRoss: Green. To the green.\\nRachel:  Never-never mind.\\nChandler: To the left, to the left- aww!\\nRachel:  Ohhh... I\\'m fine.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-05\\nMonica: Would you let it go? It\\'s not that big a deal.\\nRoss: Not that big a deal? It\\'s amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there\\'s one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I\\'m concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?\\nRachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.\\nChandler: We can? All right, I\\'m tryin\\' that.\\nJoey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.\\nPhoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don\\'t get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.\\nRoss: Multiple orgasms!\\nChandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!\\nJoey: No plans, huh?\\nChandler: Not a one.\\nRoss: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?\\nChandler: Oh, right, right, shut up.\\nMonica: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.\\nChandler: No, I know, but it\\'s just so hard, you know? I mean, you\\'re sitting there with her, she has no idea what\\'s happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there\\'s the horrible awkward moment when you\\'ve handed her the note.\\nJoey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.\\nPhoebe: You know, if you want, I\\'ll do it with you.\\nChandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she\\'d feel like we\\'re gangin\\' up on her.\\nPhoebe: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I\\'ll break up with Tony.\\nRoss: Tony?\\nMonica: Oh, you\\'re breaking up with Tony?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know, he\\'s sweet, but it\\'s just not fun anymore, you know? I don\\'t know if it\\'s me, or his hunger strike, or, I don\\'t know.\\nRachel:  Does anybody want anything else?\\nRoss: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I\\'m fine.\\nPhoebe:  What\\'s the matter? Why so scrunchy?\\nRachel: It\\'s my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.\\nRoss: That guy, he burns me up.\\nRachel: Yeah, well, it\\'s a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.\\nChandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.\\nMonica: Did he give you that whole \"You\\'re-not-up-to-this\" thing again?\\nRachel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \"You\\'ll never make it on your own\".\\nPhoebe:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.\\nAngela: Hi, Joey.\\nJoey: My god, Angela.\\nMonica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.\\nPhoebe: Are you gonna go over there?\\nJoey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don\\'t wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela.\\nAngela:  Joey.\\nJoey: You look good.\\nAngela: That\\'s because I\\'m wearing a dress that accents my boobs.\\nJoey: You don\\'t say.\\nRoss: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what\\'re you doing tonight?\\nRachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.\\nRoss: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who\\'s doing laundry there too?\\nRachel: Who?\\nRoss: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don\\'t, um, why don\\'t I just join you both, here?\\nRachel: Don\\'t you have a laundry room in your building?\\nRoss: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there\\'s a.... rat problem. Apparently they\\'re attracted to the dryer sheets, and they\\'re goin\\' in fine, but they\\'re comin\\' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?\\nRachel: Sure.\\nAngela: Forget it Joey. I\\'m with Bob now.\\nJoey: Bob? Who the hell\\'s Bob?\\nAngela: Bob is great. He\\'s smart, he\\'s sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...\\nJoey: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.\\nAngela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let\\'s just be friends, so guess what?\\nJoey: What?\\nAngela: We\\'re just friends.\\nJoey: Fine, fine, so, why don\\'t the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?\\nAngela: What four of us?\\nJoey: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.\\nJoey: Monica, I\\'m tellin\\' you, this guy is perfect for you.\\nMonica: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.\\nJoey: Come on. This guy\\'s great. His name\\'s Bob. He\\'s Angela\\'s... brother. He\\'s smart, he\\'s sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...\\nMonica:  Oh, god help us.\\nJoey: What?\\nMonica: Ugly Naked Guy\\'s laying kitchen tile. Eww!\\nJoey: Eww! Look, I\\'m asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.\\nMonica: What\\'s going on here? You go out with tons of girls.\\nJoey:  I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?\\nRoss:  Well, Monica\\'s not coming, it\\'s just gonna be me and Rachel.\\nChandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you\\'ve thought this thing through?\\nRoss: It\\'s laundry. The thinking through is minimal.\\nChandler: It\\'s just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You\\'re going on a date.\\nRoss: Nuh-uh.\\nChandler: Yuh-huh.\\nRoss: So what\\'re you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?\\nChandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she\\'s gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?\\nRoss:  No.\\nChandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?\\nRoss: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I\\'m a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.\\nChandler: There you go.\\nMonica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?\\nJoey: Yep.\\nMonica: Which?\\nJoey: Which what?\\nMonica: You\\'ve never met Bob, have you?\\nJoey: No, but he\\'s...\\nMonica: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...\\nAngela: Hey, Joey.\\nMonica: ...horribly attractive. I\\'ll be shutting up now.\\nChandler: Where are they? Where are they?\\nPhoebe: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.\\nChandler: It\\'s great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.\\nPhoebe: Eww, I don\\'t wanna do that.\\nChandler: Here we go.\\nPhoebe: Ok, have a good break-up.\\nChandler: Hey, Janice.\\nJanice: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.\\nChandler: Hey, that\\'s not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?\\nJanice: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I\\'m looking, I\\'m looking, I\\'m looking, I got you...\\nChandler: What?\\nJanice: What?\\nChandler:  What... did you get me there?\\nJanice: I got you...these.\\nChandler: Bullwinkle socks. That\\'s so sweet.\\nJanice: Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.\\nChandler: That\\'s great.\\nChandler: Well, I\\'m gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?\\nJanice:  No, no, I\\'m still working on mine.\\nChandler: That\\'s it?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, it was really hard.\\nChandler: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.\\nPhoebe: Ok, you weren\\'t there.\\nWoman: Comin\\' through. Move, move.\\nRachel: Oh, \\'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.\\nWoman: Yeah, well, now you\\'re kinda not.\\nRachel: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.\\nWoman: Oh, I\\'m sorry, is that your basket? It\\'s really pretty. Unfortunately, I don\\'t see suds.\\nRachel: What?\\nWoman: No suds, no save. Ok?\\nRoss: What\\'s goin\\' on?\\nRachel: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.\\nRoss: Was your basket on top?\\nRachel: Yeah, but, there were no suds.\\nRoss: So?\\nRachel: Well, you know, no suds, no save.\\nRoss: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That\\'s my friend\\'s machine.\\nWoman: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn\\'t in it.\\nRoss: Hey, hey, hey, that\\'s not the rule and you know it.\\nRoss:  Ok, let\\'s do laundry.\\nRachel: That was amazing. I can\\'t even send back soup.\\nRoss: Well, that\\'s because you\\'re such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.\\nRachel: What\\'s that?\\nRoss: Uberveiss. It\\'s new, it\\'s German, it\\'s extra-tough.\\nRoss: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?\\nRachel: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?\\nRoss: Rach, have you never done this before?\\nRachel: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I\\'m a laundry virgin.\\nRoss: Uh, well, don\\'t worry, I\\'ll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.\\nRachel:  Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?\\nRoss:  Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.\\nMonica:  So, where did you guys grow up?\\nAngela: Brooklyn Heights.\\nBob: Cleveland.\\nMonica: How, how did that happen?\\nJoey: Oh my god.\\nMonica: What?\\nJoey: I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I\\'m not.\\nJoey: So, you and Angela, huh?\\nBob: Yep. Pretty much.\\nJoey: You\\'re a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.\\nBob: Huh, I never really noticed.\\nJoey: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.\\nBob: Monica, Monica is great.\\nJoey: Yeah, but it\\'s not gonna last. She\\'s too much for me in bed. Sexually.\\nMonica: I\\'ve gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.\\nAngela: Yeah, isn\\'t he?\\nMonica: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.\\nAngela: You know what else? He\\'s unbelievable in bed.\\nMonica: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.\\nAngela: Huh. That\\'s nice.\\nPhoebe: Ok, you can do this. It\\'s just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.\\nChandler: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don\\'t think we should go out anymore. Janice.\\nJanice: All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.\\nRachel: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.\\nRoss: That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it\\'s like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  Uh-oh.\\nRachel: What uh-oh?\\nRoss:  Uh-oh the laundry\\'s done, uh-oh, uh-oh.\\nRachel: Ross, what\\'s the matter?\\nRoss: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry\\'s done.\\nRachel: Come on, show me.\\nRoss: All right, all right, it\\'s just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything\\'s kinda pink.\\nRachel: Oh, everything\\'s pink.\\nRoss: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I\\'m sorry, please don\\'t be upset, it could happen to anyone.\\nRachel: Except it didn\\'t. It happened to me. Oh, god, I\\'m gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father\\'s right. I can\\'t live on my own! I can\\'t even do laundry!\\nMonica: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn\\'t get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I\\'m just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I\\'ve got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?\\nMonica: Oh my god.\\nJoey: What?\\nMonica: Hello! Were we at the same table? It\\'s like... cocktails in Appalachia.\\nJoey: Come on, they\\'re close.\\nMonica: Close?

You know, I mean, it\\'s like we\\'re different. I\\'m like the bing, bing, bing. You\\'re like the boom, boom, ... boom.\\nJanice: Ow!\\nChandler: Oh, my god, I\\'m so sorry.

Now that\\'s the important part.\\nRachel: Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.\\nRachel: Whoa, I\\'m sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.\\nWoman: Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist.

Feels like two.\\nChandler: No, ten o\\'clock.\\nRoss: What?\\nChandler:  There\\'s a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o\\'clock!\\nRoss: Oh. Hel-lo!\\nChandler: She\\'s amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!\\nMonica: Well, go over to her! She\\'s not with anyone.\\nChandler: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? \\'Excuse me.

Ross, back me up here.\\nRoss: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.\\nChandler: Thank you, buddy.\\nPhoebe: Oh, oh, but y\\'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.\\nMonica: You could do that!\\nChandler: Y\\'think?\\nAll: Yeah!\\nChandler: Oh God, I can\\'t believe I\\'m even considering this... I\\'m very very aware of my tongue...\\nRoss: C\\'mon! C\\'mon!\\nChandler: Here goes.\\nAurora: ...Yes?\\nChandler: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.\\nAurora: Yes, you said that.\\nChandler: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn\\'t say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.\\nAurora: Chandler?\\nAll: Hey! You\\'re in a play! I didn\\'t know you could dance! You had a beard!\\nJoey: Whadja think?\\nAll: ...Hey! You\\'re in a play! I didn\\'t know you could dance! You had a beard!\\nJoey: C\\'mon, you guys, it wasn\\'t that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.\\nAll:  Saw your head. Saw your head.\\nChandler:\\nRachel: What is it?\\nJoey: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!\\nPhoebe: Based on this play? ...Based on this play!\\nChandler: Hey, kids.\\nAll: Hey.\\nPhoebe:  No, \\'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.\\nChandler: Well, I can\\'t believe I\\'ve been here almost seven seconds and you haven\\'t asked me how my date went.\\nMonica: Oh, right, right. How was your date, \\'Chand-lrr\\'?\\nChandler: It was unbelievable. I-I\\'ve never met anyone like her. She\\'s had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...\\nAurora: ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I\\'ve been talking about myself all night long, I\\'m sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.\\nChandler: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.\\nChandler: We talked \\'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.\\nAurora: ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.\\nChandler: Oh, I\\'m sorry, so \\'we\\' is?\\nAurora: \\'We\\' would be me and Rick.\\nJoey: Who\\'s Rick?\\nChandler: Who\\'s Rick?\\nAurora: My husband.\\nAll: Ooooohhh.\\nChandler: Oh, so you\\'re divorced?\\nAurora: No.\\nChandler: Oh, I\\'m sorry, then you\\'re widowed?...Hopefully?\\nAurora: No, I\\'m still married.\\nChandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?\\nAurora: Don\\'t worry. I imagine he\\'d be okay with you because really, he\\'s okay with Ethan.\\nChandler: Ethan? There\\'s, there\\'s an Ethan?\\nAurora: Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.\\nAll: What?!\\nChandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?\\nAurora: I suppose mainly sexual.\\nChandler: ...Hm.\\nMonica: Oh. I\\'m sorry it didn\\'t work out.\\nChandler: What \\'not work out\\'? I\\'m seeing her again on Thursday. Didn\\'t you listen to the story?\\nMonica: Didn\\'t you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?\\nChandler: Well, y\\'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy\\'s fantasy!\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?\\nRoss: No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.\\nMonica: What? So you guys don\\'t mind going out with someone else who\\'s going out with someone else?\\nJoey: I couldn\\'t do it.\\nMonica: Good for you, Joey.\\nJoey: When I\\'m with a woman, I need to know that I\\'m going out with more people than she is.\\nRoss: Well, y\\'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-\\nRoss: Fine. Fine, alright, now you\\'ll never know.\\nMonica: We\\'re kidding. C\\'mon, tell us!\\nAll: Yeah! C\\'mon!\\nRoss: Alright. There\\'s a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-\\nRachel: Tah-daaah!\\nChandler: Are we greeting each other this way now? \\'Cause I like that.\\nRachel: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don\\'t know what that\\'s for.\\nRoss: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we\\'re not supposed to ask.\\nRachel: Well, whaddya think?\\nAll: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!\\nMonica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.\\nAll: Uh-oh...\\nMonica: How-how did that happen?\\nRachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it\\'s an extra seat around the coffee table.\\nMonica: Yeah, yeah, it\\'s interesting.. but y\\'know what? Just for fun, let\\'s see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let\\'s see. Well, it looks good there too. Let\\'s just leave it there for a while.\\nPhoebe:  I can\\'t believe you tried to move the green ottoman.\\nChandler: Thank God you didn\\'t try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she\\'ll scratch your eyes right out.\\nMonica: You guys, I am not that bad!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y\\'know,  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!\\nMonica: That is so unfair!\\nRoss: Oh c\\'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn\\'t raggedy!\\nMonica: Okay, so I\\'m responsible, I\\'m organised. But hey, I can be a kook.\\nRoss: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don\\'t pay it right away.\\nMonica: Why not?\\nRoss: Because you\\'re a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.\\nMonica: I could do that.\\nRachel: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it\\'s not the one with the easy-pour spout.\\nMonica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.\\nChandler: Someone\\'s left a glass on the coffee table. There\\'s no coaster. It\\'s a cold drink, it\\'s a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...\\nMonica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It\\'s true! Who am I?\\nRoss: Monica? You\\'re Mom.\\nPhoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!\\nJoey:  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!\\nAll: Oh my God! Whoah!\\nMonica: Well, what\\'s the part?\\nJoey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy\\'s the reason I became an actor! \"I\\'m out of order? Pfeeeh. You\\'re out of order! This whole courtroom\\'s out of order!\"\\nPhoebe: Seriously, what-what\\'s the part?\\nJoey: \"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!\"\\nRoss: C\\'mon, seriously, Joey, what\\'s the part?\\nJoey: ...I\\'m his\\nRachel: ..You\\'re, you\\'re \\'mah mah mah\\' what?\\nJoey: ...I\\'m his butt double. \\'Kay?

This is a real movie, and Al Pacino\\'s in it, and that\\'s big!\\nChandler: Oh no, it\\'s terrific, it\\'s... it\\'s... y\\'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you\\'ve finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.\\nJoey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don\\'t care! This is a big break for me!\\nRoss: You\\'re right, you\\'re right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: Alright, alright, alright...\\nJoey: Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.\\nMonica: For what?\\nJoey: Whaddya think? Today\\'s the big day!\\nMonica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don\\'t ever tell me what you did in there.\\nJoey: Thank you!\\nChandler: Where\\'s Joey? His mom\\'s on the phone.\\nMonica: He\\'s in the bathroom. I don\\'t think you wanna go in there!\\nChandler: C\\'mon, we\\'re roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!\\nMonica: I warned you...\\nRachel: Who is being loud?\\nChandler: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.\\nMonica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?\\nChandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y\\'know..\\nRachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?\\nChandler: No, no resentment, believe me, it\\'s worth it. \\'Kay? Y\\'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you\\'ll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I\\'ve just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?\\nMonica: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y\\'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I\\'m not gonna do that.\\nDirector:  Okay, everybody ready?\\nJoey: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.\\nDirector: Lose the robe.\\nJoey: Me?\\nDirector: That would work.\\nJoey: Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.\\nDirector: Okay, everybody, we\\'d like to get this in one take, please. Let\\'s roll it.. water\\'s working .. and... action.\\nDirector: And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?\\nJoey: Well, I\\'m- I\\'m showering.\\nDirector: No, that was clenching.\\nJoey: Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy\\'s upset here, y\\'know? I mean, his wife\\'s dead, his brother\\'s missing... I think his butt would be angry here.\\nDirector: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?\\nJoey: I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...\\nChandler: God, I love these fingers...\\nAurora: Thank you.\\nChandler: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at \\'em, look at how happy they are.\\nAurora:\\nChandler: Oh no nonononononnononono, don\\'t go..\\nAurora: Okay.\\nChandler: Don\\'t go.\\nAurora: Okay. Oh no, I have to.\\nChandler:  Too bad, she\\'s leaving.\\nAurora:  I\\'m sorry. He\\'ll be waiting for me.\\nChandler: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.\\nAurora: It\\'s not Rick.\\nChandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!\\nAurora: No, it\\'s-it\\'s Andrew.\\nChandler: I know there\\'ll be many moments in the years to come when I\\'ll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?\\nAurora: He\\'s... new.\\nChandler: Oh, so what you\\'re saying is you\\'re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?\\nAurora: No, that\\'s not exactly what I was..\\nChandler: Well, y\\'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.\\nAurora: So what do you want?\\nChandler: You.\\nAurora: You have me!\\nChandler: Nono, just you.\\nAurora: Whaddyou mean?\\nChandler: Lose the other guys.\\nAurora: ...Like, ...all of them?\\nChandler: C\\'mon, we\\'re great together, why not?\\nAurora: Why can\\'t we just have what we have now? Why can\\'t we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that\\'s what you wanted too.\\nChandler: ...Well, y\\'know, part of me wants that, but it\\'s like I\\'m two guys, y\\'know? I mean, one guy\\'s going \\'Shut up! This is great!\\' But there\\'s this other guy. Actually it\\'s the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch\\'s heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he\\'s saying, y\\'know, \\'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!\\'\\nAurora: So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don\\'t exactly let each other finish...\\nAurora: Which one?\\nChandler: ...The second guy.\\nAurora:  Well, call me if you change your mind.\\nChandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.\\nRoss: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?\\nAll: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey, waitwait, aren\\'t you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?\\nJoey: Nope.\\nRoss: No? What happened, big guy?\\nChandler:  \"Big guy?\"\\nRoss: It felt like a \\'big guy\\' moment.\\nJoey: I got fired.\\nAll: Oh!\\nJoey: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody\\'s gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...\\nRachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.\\nJoey: My mom will.\\nChandler: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.\\nJoey: Y\\'know, I\\'ve done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!\\nMonica: Maybe this wasn\\'t your shot.\\nRoss: Yeah, I mean... I think when it\\'s your shot, y\\'know, you-you know it\\'s your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?\\nJoey: Hard to tell, I was naked.\\nPhoebe: No, I don\\'t think this was your shot. I mean, I don\\'t even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You\\'ve gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go \\'I got the part! I got the part! I\\'m gonna be Joey Tribbiani\\'s ass!\\'.\\nJoey: Yeah? That\\'s so nice!\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, Joey. I\\'m gonna go to bed, guys.\\nAll: Night.\\nRachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?\\nMonica:  Uh-huh!\\nRachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?\\nMonica: Doesn\\'t matter, I\\'ll get \\'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.\\nRoss: She is a kook.\\nClosing Credits\\nMonica:\\nEnd\\n======== 01-07\\nWritten by: Jeffrey Astrof and Mike Sikowitz. Transcribed by: Ruth Curran\\nRachel: Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh...

I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What\\'s my number?\\nPhoebe: Well, I never call me.\\nChandler: Oh my God, it\\'s that Victoria\\'s Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.\\nJill:  Hi Mom, it\\'s Jill.\\nChandler: She\\'s right, it\\'s Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it\\'s an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!\\nJill:  Yeah, I\\'m fine. I\\'m just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.\\nChandler: Jill says vestibule... I\\'m going with vestibule.\\nJill:  I\\'m fine. No, I\\'m not alone... I don\\'t know, some guy.\\nChandler: Oh! Some guy. Some guy. \\'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.\\nJoey: Hi everyone.\\nRoss: And officiating at tonight\\'s blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.\\nJoey: Well, Chandler\\'s old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.\\nPhoebe:  Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.\\nRachel: That had to hurt!\\nChandler: Alright, alright, alright. It\\'s been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!\\nChandler: There you go!\\nChandler: You\\'re definitely scaring here.\\nJill:\\nChandler: Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.\\nMonica: Hello?\\nChandler: Hey, it\\'s me.\\nMonica:  Are you OK?\\nChandler: Yeah, I\\'m fine.

OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.\\nAll: Whoooaa!\\nRoss: That\\'s my sister.\\nJoey: OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women\\'s room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.\\nMonica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?\\nRoss: Pheebs, what about you?\\nPhoebe: Oh... Milwaukee.\\nRachel: Um... Ross?\\nRoss: Disneyland, 1989, \\'It\\'s a Small World After All.\\'\\nAll: No way!\\nRoss: The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.\\nPhoebe: Oh, Rachel.\\nRachel: Oh come on, I already went.\\nMonica: You did not go!\\nAll: Come on.\\nRachel: Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.\\nRoss: Step back.\\nJoey: We have a winner!\\nRachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.\\nRoss: Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn\\'t have a line.\\nRachel: There, well, see? Barry wouldn\\'t even kiss me on a miniature golf course.\\nRoss: Come on.\\nRachel: No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.\\nRoss:  And you didn\\'t marry him because...?\\nRachel: I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...\\nRoss: Probably. But you know, I\\'ll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.\\nRachel: Yeah right.\\nRoss: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you\\'re left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there\\'s all that other good stuff.\\nRachel:  OK.\\nRoss: But, um... I don\\'t think that\\'s going to be you.\\nRachel: You don\\'t.\\nRoss: Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.\\nRachel: Really?\\nRoss: Mmmm.\\nRachel: You do?\\nRoss: I do.\\nRachel: Oh Ross, you\\'re so great.\\nJoey: It\\'s never gonna happen.\\nRoss:  What?\\nJoey: You and Rachel.\\nRoss:  Why not?\\nJoey: Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you\\'re in the friend zone.\\nRoss: No, no, no. I\\'m not in the zone.\\nJoey: Ross, you\\'re mayor of the zone.\\nRoss: I\\'m taking my time, alright? I\\'m laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...\\nJoey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I\\'m telling you, she has no idea what you\\'re thinking. If you don\\'t ask her out soon you\\'re going to end up stuck in the zone forever.\\nRoss: I will, I will. See, I\\'m waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?\\nJoey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What\\'s messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You\\'ve just got to go up to her and say, \\'Rachel, I think that...\\'\\nRoss: Shhhh!\\nRachel: What are you shushing?\\nRoss: We\\'re shushing... because... we\\'re trying to hear something. Listen.  Don\\'t you hear that?\\nRachel: Ahhhh!\\nRoss: See?\\nRachel: Huh.\\nJill: Would you like some gum?\\nChandler: Um, is it sugarless?\\nJill:  Sorry, it\\'s not.\\nChandler: Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.\\nPhoebe:\\nRoss:  OK, here goes.\\nJoey: Are you going to do it?\\nRoss: I\\'m going to do it.\\nJoey: Do you want any help?\\nRoss: You come out there, you\\'re a dead man.\\nJoey: Good luck, man.\\nRoss: Thanks.  OK.\\nJoey: OK.\\nJoey: Hey, where are you going?\\nMonica: Outside.\\nJoey: You can\\'t go out there.\\nMonica: Why not?\\nJoey: Because of... the reason.\\nMonica: And that would be?\\nJoey: I, um, can\\'t tell you.\\nMonica: Joey, what\\'s going on?\\nJoey: OK, you\\'ve got to promise that you\\'ll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.\\nMonica: About what?\\nJoey: He\\'s planning your birthday party.\\nMonica: Oh my God! I love him!\\nJoey:  You\\'d better act surprised.\\nPhoebe: About what?\\nMonica: My surprise party!\\nPhoebe: What surprise party?\\nMonica: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.\\nPhoebe: Well, he didn\\'t tell me.\\nJoey: Hey, don\\'t look at me. This is Ross\\'s thing.\\nPhoebe: This is so typical. I\\'m always the last one to know everything.\\nMonica: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.\\nPhoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.\\nRachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.\\nRoss: OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it\\'s not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.\\nRachel: OK.\\nRoss: OK. Here goes. For a while now, I\\'ve been wanting to, um....\\nRachel: Ohhh!!!!\\nRoss: Yes, yes, that\\'s right...\\nRachel: Oh, look at the little cat!\\nRoss: What?  Ow!\\nMonica, Joey, and Phoebe:  I\\'m on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I\\'ve found ever since...\\nMonica:  This is just Bactine. It won\\'t hurt.\\nJoey: Sorry, that was wax.\\nPhoebe: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.\\nRoss: Why don\\'t we just put \\'poor little Tooty\\' out in the hall?\\nRachel: During a blackout? He\\'d get trampled!\\nRoss:  Yeah?\\nChandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  \\'Gum would be perfection\\'? \\'Gum would be perfection.\\' Could have said \\'gum would be nice,\\' or \\'I\\'ll have a stick,\\' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.\\nPhoebe:  Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?\\nRachel: Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we\\'re looking for the owner.\\nMr. Heckles: Er, yeah, it\\'s mine.\\nPhoebe:  He seems to hate you. Are you sure?\\nMr. Heckles: Yeah, it\\'s my cat. Give me my cat.\\nPhoebe: Wait a minute. What\\'s his name?\\nMr. Heckles: Ehhhh... B-Buttons.\\nRachel: Bob Buttons?\\nMr. Heckles: Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.\\nPhoebe:  Oooh! You are a very bad man!\\nMr. Heckles:  You owe me a cat.\\nRachel: Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...\\nPaolo:\\nRachel: Wow.\\nRoss:  Lucky sixes....\\nRachel:  Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.\\nMonica:  Hi!\\nRachel: And Joey....\\nMonica: Hi!\\nRachel: And Ross.\\nMonica: Hi!\\nPaolo:\\nRachel:  He doesn\\'t speak much English.\\nPaolo:  Monopoly!\\nRachel: Look at that!\\nRoss:  So, um... where did Paolo come from?\\nRachel: Oh... Italy, I think.\\nRoss: No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.\\nRachel: Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo\\'s cat!\\nRoss: That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.\\nPhoebe: Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn\\'t find the kitty anywhere.\\nRachel: Oh, I found him. He was Paolo\\'s cat.\\nPhoebe: Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I\\'m guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.\\nRachel: Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.\\nPaolo:\\nPhoebe:  You betcha!\\nChandler:  Ah, let\\'s see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble\\'s good. It\\'s got a... boyish charm, it\\'s impish. Here we go.\\nChandler: Nice going, imp. OK, it\\'s OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.\\nChandler: Good save! We\\'re back on track, and I\\'m...  ..chewing someone else\\'s gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you\\'re choking.\\nJill: Are you alright?\\nJill: My God, you\\'re choking!  That better?\\nChandler:  Yes... thank you. That was... that was....\\nJill: Perfection?\\nPaolo:\\nRoss:  Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....\\nRoss: Wha-What did he say that was so funny?\\nRachel: I have absolutely no idea.\\nRoss: That\\'s... that\\'s classic.\\nRachel:  Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!\\nMonica: If you want, I\\'ll do it.\\nPhoebe: I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won\\'t.\\nRachel: God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.\\nPhoebe: You know, did you ride mopeds? \\'Cause I\\'ve heard... ... oh, I see... it\\'s not about that right now. OK.\\nRachel: Y\\'know, I know it\\'s totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don\\'t even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....\\nRoss: Paolo. Hi.\\nPaolo: Ross!\\nRoss: Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we\\'re kind of a thing.\\nPaolo: Thing?\\nRoss: Thing, yes. Thing.\\nPaolo: Ah, you... have the sex?\\nRoss: No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that\\'s... see, that\\'s not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...\\nPaolo: Bed?\\nRoss: No, no, that\\'s not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.\\nPaolo: Oh!\\nRoss: Yeah! Se vice?\\nPaolo: Si.\\nRoss: So you do know a little English.\\nPaolo: Poco... a leetle.\\nRoss: Do you know the word crapweasel?\\nPaolo: No.\\nRoss: That\\'s funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!\\nJill: Chandler, we\\'ve been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it\\'s easy.\\nChandler: OK.\\nJill: Ready?\\nJill: No, you\\'ve got to whip it.\\nPhoebe: Oh, look look look. The last candle\\'s about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...\\nRoss: Thank you.\\nPhoebe: Thanks.\\nRoss: Kinda... spooky without any lights.\\nJoey:  Bwah-hah-hah!\\nRoss: OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...\\nRoss: Oh.. oh... oh.\\nJoey: Hey Ross. This probably isn\\'t the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.\\nJill: Well, this has been fun.\\nChandler: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.\\nJill: Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.\\nChandler: Hi, um, I\\'m account number 7143457. And, uh, I don\\'t know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-08\\nWritten by: Marta Kaufmann & David Crane Transcribed by: guineapig With Help From: Rachel Stigge\\n[Scene: Chandler\\'s Office, Chandler is on a coffee break.  Shelley enters.)  Shelley: Hey gorgeous, how\\'s it going?\\nChandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?\\nShelley: Question. You\\'re not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.\\nChandler: Ah, y\\'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said \\'co-dependent\\', or \\'self-destructive\\'...\\nShelley: Do you want a date Saturday?\\nChandler: Yes please.\\nShelley: Okay. He\\'s cute, he\\'s funny, he\\'s-\\nChandler: He\\'s a he?\\nShelley: Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I\\'m just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...\\nOpening Credits\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there.)\\nChandler: ...Couldn\\'t enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?\\nRachel: Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y\\'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...\\nChandler: You did?\\nRachel: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe\\'s entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.\\nChandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?\\nMonica: I did.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I think so, yeah.\\nJoey: Not me.\\nRoss: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y\\'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.\\nChandler: You\\'re kidding! Did you tell her I wasn\\'t?\\nRoss: No. No, it\\'s just \\'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...\\nChandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?\\nPhoebe: I dunno, \\'cause you\\'re smart, you\\'re funny...\\nChandler: Ross is smart and funny, d\\'you ever think that about him?\\nAll: Yeah! Right!\\nChandler: WHAT IS IT?!\\nMonica: Okay, I-I d\\'know, you-you just- you have a quality.\\nAll: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.\\nChandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.\\nMonica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it\\'s Paolo calling from Rome.\\nRachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio.\\nRoss:  So he\\'s calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.\\nRachel: Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I\\'m talking to Rome.\\nMonica: Hey dad, what\\'s up?  Oh God. Ross, it\\'s Nana.\\n[Scene: The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.)\\nRoss: So, uh, how\\'s she doing?\\nAunt Lillian: The doctor says it\\'s a matter of hours.\\nMonica: How-how are you, Mom?\\nMrs. Geller: Me? I\\'m fine, fine. I\\'m glad you\\'re here. ...What\\'s with your hair?\\nMonica: What?\\nMrs. Geller: What\\'s different?\\nMonica: Nothing.\\nMrs. Geller: Oh, maybe that\\'s it.\\nMonica: She is unbelievable, our mother is...\\nRoss: Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.\\nMonica: Oh God!\\nMonica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.\\nRoss: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet \\'n\\' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.\\nMr. Geller: Not just restaurants, from our house.\\nNurse: Mrs. Geller?\\nRoss: She looks so small.\\nMonica: I know.\\nRoss: Well, at least she\\'s with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.\\nMonica: G\\'bye, Nana.\\nRoss: Bye, Nana.\\nMonica: Ross!\\nMrs. Geller: What is going on?!\\nRoss: Y\\'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she\\'s not, quite..\\nMrs. Geller: What?\\nRoss: She\\'s not- past, she\\'s present, she\\'s back.\\nAunt Lillian:  What\\'s going on?\\nMr. Geller: She may have died.\\nAunt Lillian: She may have died?\\nMr. Geller: We\\'re looking into it.\\nRoss: I, uh, I\\'ll go see.\\nNurse: This almost never happens!\\nRoss: Now she\\'s passed.\\nChandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?\\nRachel:  Yes, Chandler, that\\'s exactly what it is. It\\'s your hair.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you have homosexual hair.\\nRachel: So, um, did she...\\nRoss: Twice.\\nJoey: Twice?\\nPhoebe: Oh, that sucks!\\nJoey: You guys okay?\\nRoss: I dunno, it\\'s weird. I mean, I know she\\'s gone, but I just don\\'t feel, uh...\\nPhoebe: Maybe that\\'s \\'cause she\\'s not really gone.\\nRoss: Nono, she\\'s gone.\\nMonica: We checked. A lot.\\nPhoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she\\'s like right here, y\\'know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y\\'know? ...I miss her.\\nRachel: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?\\nPhoebe: Thanks!\\nRachel: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.\\nJoey: Now, see, I don\\'t believe any of that. I think once you\\'re dead, you\\'re dead! You\\'re gone! You\\'re worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?\\nPhoebe: Y\\'know, I dunno who this is, but it\\'s not Debbie.\\nRoss: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.\\nMrs. Geller: Well, that doesn\\'t mean she can\\'t look nice!\\nMrs. Geller: Sweetie, you think you can get in there?\\nRoss:  I don\\'t see why not.\\nRoss: Here\\'s my retainer!\\nMr. Geller: I was just thinking. When my time comes-\\nMonica: Dad!\\nMr. Geller: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.\\nMonica: You what?\\nMr. Geller: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.\\nMonica: Define fun.\\nMr. Geller: C\\'mon, you\\'ll make a day of it! You\\'ll rent a boat, pack a lunch...\\nMonica: ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.\\nMr. Geller: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says \\'Jack Geller, so predictable\\'. Maybe after I\\'m gone, they\\'ll say \\'Buried at sea! Huh!\\'.\\nMonica: That\\'s probably what they\\'ll say.\\nMr. Geller: I\\'d like that.\\nChandler: Hey, gorgeous.\\nShelley:  Hey. Look, I\\'m sorry about yesterday, I, um-\\nChandler: No, nono, don\\'t- don\\'t worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.\\nShelley: Oh! Okay! Phew!\\nChandler: So, uh... what do you think it is about me?\\nShelley: I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...\\nChandler: ...Quality, right, great.\\nShelley: Y\\'know, it\\'s a shame, because you and Lowell would\\'ve made a great couple.\\nChandler: Lowell? Financial Services\\' Lowell, that\\'s who you saw me with?\\nShelley: What? He\\'s cute!\\nChandler: Well, yeah... \\'s\\'no Brian in Payroll.\\nShelley: Is Brian...?\\nChandler: No! Uh, I d\\'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I\\'d like to think you\\'d set me up with someone like him.\\nShelley: Well, I think Brian\\'s a little out of your league.\\nChandler: Excuse me? You don\\'t think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I\\'m really not.\\nRoss:  This one?\\nAunt Lillian: No.\\nRoss: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.\\nAunt Lillian: You know, whatever we pick, she would\\'ve told us it\\'s the wrong one.\\nMrs. Geller: You\\'re right. We\\'ll go with the burgundy.\\nRoss: Oh! A fine choice. I\\'m coming out.\\nAunt Lillian: Wait! We need shoes!\\nRoss: Okay. Um, how about these?\\nMrs. Geller: That\\'s really a day shoe.\\nRoss: And where she\\'s going everyone else\\'ll be dressier?\\nAunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?\\nRoss:  Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.\\nAunt Lillian: No, it really should be burgundy.\\nMrs. Geller: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?\\nRoss: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.\\nRoss: Oh my God..\\nMrs. Geller: Is everything all right, dear?\\nRoss: Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.\\nCommercial Break\\nRoss:  How we doing, you guys ready?\\nMonica: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?\\nRoss: Some days it\\'s all I can think about.\\nPhoebe:  Hi, sorry I\\'m late, I couldn\\'t find my bearings.\\nRachel: Oh, you-you mean your earrings?\\nPhoebe: What\\'d I say?\\nRachel:  Hm-m.\\nMonica: Are these the shoes?\\nRachel: Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.\\nRoss: What, we-uh- we don\\'t have shoes here, or...?\\nJoey:  Morning. We ready to go?\\nChandler: Well, don\\'t we look nice all dressed up?...It\\'s stuff like that, isn\\'t it?\\nMonica: It was a really beautiful service.\\nMrs. Geller: It really was. Oh, c\\'mere, sweetheart.  Y\\'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.\\nJoey: What?\\nChandler: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.\\nJoey: Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.\\nChandler: You\\'re watching a football game at a funeral?\\nJoey: No, it\\'s the pre-game. I\\'m gonna watch it at the reception.\\nChandler: You are a frightening, frightening man.\\nRachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!\\nRoss: Oh, I hope they\\'re not ruined.\\nPhoebe: God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!\\nRoss: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana\\'s gone there\\'s, there\\'s something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-\\nAll: God! Ross!\\nRoss: I\\'m fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...\\nPhoebe: Okay, don\\'t worry, I\\'m just checking to see if the muscle\\'s in spasm...huh.\\nRoss: What, what is it?\\nPhoebe: You missed a belt loop.\\nRoss: Oh! No-n-\\nPhoebe: Okay, it\\'s in spasm.\\nMrs. Geller: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.\\nChandler: Oh, no-\\nAndrea: Sorry- Hi, I\\'m Dorothy\\'s daughter.\\nChandler: Hi, I\\'m Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.\\nPhoebe: Hey, look who\\'s up! How do you feel?\\nRoss: I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.\\nMonica: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?\\nRoss: Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister\\nPhoebe: Ooh! That\\'s so nice...\\nRoss: ...Chandler!\\nChandler: Hey.\\nRoss:  And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn\\'t matter to me.\\nAndrea:\\nRoss: Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.\\nRachel:  Oh, well you know who I love the most?\\nRoss: No.\\nRachel: You!\\nRoss: Oh.. you don\\'t get it!\\nMr. Geller: Whaddya got there?\\nJoey:  Just a, uh... hearing disability.\\nMr. Geller: What\\'s the score?\\nJoey: Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.\\nMr. Geller: Beautiful!\\nRachel:  Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?\\nMrs. Geller:  Your grandmother would have hated this.\\nMonica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.\\nMrs. Geller: No, I\\'d be hearing about \\'Why didn\\'t I get the honey-glazed ham?\\', I didn\\'t spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she\\'d be saying \\'Why are you wasting your money? I don\\'t need flowers, I\\'m dead\\'.\\nMonica: That sounds like Nana.\\nMrs. Geller: Do you know what it\\'s like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?\\nMonica: ...I can imagine.\\nMrs. Geller: I\\'m telling you, it\\'s a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.\\nMonica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?\\nMrs. Geller: Tell her what?\\nMonica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.\\nMrs. Geller: I\\'m not sure I know what you\\'re getting at.\\nMonica: Do you think things would have been better if you\\'d just told her the truth?\\nMrs. Geller: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it\\'s nicer when people just get along.\\nMonica: Huh.\\nMrs. Geller: More wine, dear?\\nMonica: Oh, I think so.\\nMrs. Geller:  Those earrings look really lovely on you.\\nMonica: Thank you. They\\'re yours.\\nMrs. Geller: Actually they were Nana\\'s.\\nMr. Geller: Now I\\'m depressed! ... Even more than I was.\\nRachel: Hey, who\\'s this little naked guy?\\nRoss: That little naked guy would be me.\\nRachel: Aww, look at the little thing.\\nRoss: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?\\nChandler: Who are those people?\\nRoss: Got me.\\nMonica: Oh, that\\'s Nana, right there in the middle.  \\'Me and the gang at Java Joe\\'s\\'.\\nRachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?\\nMonica: Let\\'s see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?\\nRoss: Looks like a fun gang.\\nJoey: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!\\nRoss:  Nono, that would be me again. I\\'m, uh, just trying something.\\nClosing Credits\\nChandler: Hey, Lowell.\\nLowell: Hey, Chandler.\\nChandler: So how\\'s it going there in Financial Services?\\nLowell: It\\'s like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How \\'bout you?\\nChandler: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I\\'m not.\\nLowell: I know. That\\'s what I told her.\\nChandler: Really.\\nLowell: Yeah.\\nChandler: So- you can tell?\\nLowell: Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.\\nChandler: So you don\\'t think I have a, a quality?\\nLowell: Speaking for my people, I\\'d have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.\\nChandler: He is?\\nLowell: Yup, and waaay out of your league.\\nChandler: Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-09\\nRachel: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven\\'t worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?\\nTerry: An advance?\\nRachel: It\\'s so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.\\nTerry: Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You\\'re a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.\\nRachel: Ok, I, I hear what you\\'re sayin\\'. I\\'m with you. Um, but I, but I\\'m trying really hard. And I think I\\'m doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh, look at that.\\nRachel: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there\\'s a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?\\nGuy: Huh?\\nRachel: Ok, ok, that\\'s fine. Fine. Hey, I\\'m sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.\\nMonica: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?\\nRoss: No, they\\'re not.\\nMonica: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.\\nRoss: You\\'re wrong.\\nMonica: I am not wrong.\\nRoss: You\\'re wrong.\\nMonica: No, I just talked to them.\\nRoss:  I\\'m calling Mom.\\nJoey: Hey, hey.\\nChandler: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nChandler: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?\\nJoey: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.\\nChandler: That\\'s so funny, \\'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.\\nPhoebe: What were you modeling for?\\nJoey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?\\nMonica: Oh, wow, so you\\'re gonna be one of those \"healthy, healthy, healthy guys\"?\\nPhoebe: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.\\nChandler: Do you know which one you\\'re gonna be?\\nJoey: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...\\nChandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.\\nJoey: Thanks.\\nRoss:  Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It\\'s Thanksgiving.\\nMonica: Ok, I\\'ll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I\\'ll make it just like Mom\\'s.\\nRoss: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?\\nMonica: You know, they\\'re not actually supposed to have...  I\\'ll work on the lumps. Joey, you\\'re going home, right?\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nMonica: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.\\nChandler: Yes, every single one of them.\\nMonica: Phoebe, you\\'re gonna be with your grandma?\\nPhoebe: Yes, and her boyfriend. But we\\'re celebrating Thanksgiving in December \\'cause he is lunar.\\nMonica: So you\\'re free Thursday, then.\\nPhoebe: Yeah. Oh, can I come?\\nMonica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you\\'re gonna make it to Vail?\\nRachel: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.\\nChandler: I thought it was $98.50.\\nRachel: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.\\nRoss: Well, I\\'m off to Carol\\'s.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don\\'t we invite her?\\nRoss:  Ooh, ooh. Because she\\'s my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.\\nRoss: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?\\nSusan: No, she\\'s at a faculty meeting.\\nRoss: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.\\nRoss: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.\\nSusan: What\\'s it look like?\\nRoss: Kinda like a big face without skin.\\nSusan: Yes, I\\'m familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.\\nRoss: Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein\\' a lesbian.\\nSusan: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don\\'t let you do it.\\nRoss:  Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.\\nSusan: Actually, I\\'m reading it to the baby.\\nRoss: The uh, the baby that hasn\\'t been born yet? Wouldn\\'t that mean you\\'re... crazy?\\nSusan: What, you don\\'t think they can hear sounds in there?\\nRoss: You\\'re not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?\\nSusan: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.\\nRoss: Do you uh, do you talk about me?\\nSusan: Yeah, yeah, all the time.\\nRoss: Really?\\nSusan: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.\\nRoss: Look, if she\\'s talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we\\'ll all talk, and you\\'ll hear everything we say.\\nChandler: I\\'d just like to say that I\\'m totally behind this experiment. In fact, I\\'d very much like to butter your head.\\nMonica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?\\nRachel: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.\\nMonica: Rach, here\\'s your mail.\\nRachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.\\nMonica:  No, here\\'s your mail.\\nRachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.\\nMonica:  Would you just open it?\\nRachel: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.\\nMonica: We all chipped in.\\nJoey:  We did?\\nMonica:  You owe me 20 bucks.\\nRachel: Thank you. Thank you so much!\\nMonica:  Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin\\'s, and your family size bag of Funyuns.\\nRachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you\\'re havin\\' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?\\nChandler: All right, I\\'m nine years old.\\nRoss: Oh, I hate this story.\\nChandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they\\'re getting divorced.\\nRachel: Oh my god.\\nChandler: Yes. It\\'s very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you\\'ve seen it in reverse.\\nJoey: Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.\\nGirl: We did?\\nJoey: Yeah, at Macy\\'s. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?\\nGirl: Yeah, right.\\nJoey: I gotta tell you. You\\'re the best in the business.\\nGirl: Get out.\\nJoey: I\\'m serious. You\\'re amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.\\nGirl: Really? You don\\'t know what that means to me.\\nJoey: Ooh, you smell great tonight. What\\'re you wearing?\\nGirl:  Nothing.\\nJoey: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?\\nGirl: Yeah.  Oh.\\nJoey: What\\'s wrong?\\nGirl: I just remembered, I have to do something.\\nJoey: Oh. What?\\nGirl: Um, leave.\\nJoey: Wait, wait, wait!\\nJoey: So I guess you all saw it.\\nRachel: Saw what?\\nPhoebe: No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.\\nJoey: Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.\\nChandler: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.\\nMonica: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider\\'s mulling, turkey\\'s turking, yams are yamming.  What?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know. It\\'s just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.\\nMonica: All right, that\\'s it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.\\nRoss: That\\'s closer.\\nRachel: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.\\nChandler: Oh, you must stop shooping.\\nRachel: Ok, I\\'m gonna get my stuff.\\nJoey: Chandler, will you just come in already?\\nChandler: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.\\nPhoebe: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!\\nChandler: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that\\'s not funny anymore.\\nJoey: Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don\\'t see any tater tots.\\nMonica: That\\'s not a question.\\nJoey: But my mom always makes them. It\\'s like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It\\'s bad enough I can\\'t be with my family because of my disease.\\nMonica: All right, fine. Tonight\\'s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.\\nRoss: Ok, I\\'m off to talk to my unborn child.\\nMonica: Ah!\\nRoss: Ok, Mom never hit.\\nPhoebe:  Ok, all done.\\nMonica: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'m sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.\\nMonica: Why would we do that?\\nPhoebe: Well, \\'cause then they\\'d be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.\\nMonica: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.\\nRachel: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!\\nChandler: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.\\nJoey: The balloon?\\nChandler: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It\\'s all over the news. Right before he reached Macy\\'s, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I\\'m goin\\' to the roof, who\\'s with me?\\nRachel: I can\\'t, I gotta go.\\nChandler: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?\\nPhoebe: Almost never.\\nMonica: Got the keys? or Got the keys!\\nRachel: Ok.\\nCarol: Anytime you\\'re ready.\\nRoss: Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...\\nCarol: Just aim for the bump.\\nRoss: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can\\'t do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.\\nCarol: So don\\'t do it, it\\'s fine. You don\\'t have to do it just because Susan does it.\\nRoss:  Hello, baby. Hello, hello.\\nRachel: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.\\nMonica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?\\nRachel: We\\'re waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.\\nMonica: No I don\\'t.\\nRachel: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, \"got the keys.\"\\nMonica: No I didn\\'t. I asked, \"got the ke-eys?\"\\nRachel: No, no, no, you said, \"got the keys\".\\nChandler: Do either of you have the keys?\\nMonica:  The oven is on.\\nRachel: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!\\nJoey: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.\\nMonica: Well then get it, get it!\\nJoey: That tone will not make me go any faster.\\nMonica:  Joey!\\nJoey: That one will.\\nRoss: And everyone\\'s telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I\\'m saying, because, let\\'s face it, you\\'re a fetus. You\\'re just happy you don\\'t have gills anymore.\\nCarol: Look, you don\\'t have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.\\nRoss: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?\\nSusan: Hi, how\\'s it goin?\\nRoss: Shh!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?\\nCarol: I did.\\nRoss: Does it always, uh--?\\nCarol: No, no that was the first.\\nSusan: Keep singing! Keep singing!\\nRoss:  Hey, hey, you\\'re my baby, and I can\\'t wait to meet you. When you come out I\\'ll buy you a bagel, and then we\\'ll go to the zoo.\\nSusan: I felt it!\\nRoss:  Hey, hey, I\\'m your daddy. I\\'m the one without any breasts.\\nJoey: Nope, not that one.\\nMonica: Can you go any faster with that?\\nJoey: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.\\nMonica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?\\nChandler:  For an emergency just like this.\\nRachel:  right now. But I\\'m not.\\nMonica: I swear you said you had the keys.\\nRachel: No, I didn\\'t. I wouldn\\'t say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn\\'t have the keys.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, ok, that\\'s it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.\\nMonica: Why would I have the keys?\\nRachel: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?\\nMonica: But I didn\\'t.\\nRachel: Well, you should have.\\nMonica: Why?\\nRachel: Because!\\nMonica: Why?\\nRachel: Because!\\nMonica: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn\\'t it enough that I\\'m making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I\\'m making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it\\'s my first Thanksgiving, and it\\'s all burned, and, and I... I...\\nChandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door\\'s open. Here we go.\\nMonica: Well, the turkey\\'s burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.\\nRoss: Here we come, walkin\\' down thethis doesn\\'t smell like Mom\\'s.\\nMonica: No, it doesn\\'t, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?  Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.\\nRachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I\\'m stuck here with you guys.\\nJoey: Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody\\'s first choice.\\nMonica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?\\nJoey: You call that delicious?\\nMonica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!\\nChandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.\\nPhoebe: Ooh.\\nRachel: What?\\nPhoebe: Ugly Naked Guy\\'s taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He\\'s not alone. Ugly Naked Guy\\'s having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.\\nJoey: I\\'ve gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!\\nMonica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!\\nPhoebe: It\\'s nice that he has someone.\\nChandler: Shall I carve?\\nRachel: By all means.\\nChandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?\\nRoss: I don\\'t even wanna know about the dark cheese.\\nMonica:  Does anybody wanna split this with me?\\nJoey: Oh, I will.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.\\nMonica: Make a wish?\\nPhoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What\\'d you wish for?\\nJoey: The bigger half.\\nChandler: I\\'d like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn\\'t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\\nAll: That\\'s so sweet.\\nRoss: And hey, here\\'s to a lousy Christmas.\\nRachel: And a crappy New Year.\\nChandler: Here, here!\\n[Scene: The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath. The captions read, as follows:\\nBladder Control Problem     Stop Wife Beating     Hemorrhoids?     Winner of 3 Tony Awards...\\nHe\\'s finally happy with that and walks away.]\\nEnd\\n======== 01-10\\nRoss: Guys? There\\'s a somebody I\\'d like you to meet.\\nAll: Oooh!\\nMonica: W-wait. What is that?\\nRoss: \\'That\\' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?\\nMonica: No, no, I don\\'t.\\nRachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?\\nRoss: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.\\nPhoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?\\nChandler: Hey, that monkey\\'s got a Ross on its ass!\\nMonica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?\\nRoss: Yeah. I mean, it\\'s been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...\\nMonica: Why don\\'t you just get a roommate?\\nRoss: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that\\'s, that\\'s \\'pathet\\', which is Sanskrit for \\'really cool way to live\\'.\\nOpening Credits\\nPhoebe: So you guys, I\\'m doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother\\'s suicide, and one about a snowman.\\nChandler: Might wanna open with the snowman.\\nAll: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.\\nMonica: So, how\\'d it go?\\nJoey: Ahhhhhh, I didn\\'t get the job.\\nRoss: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.\\nJoey: I dunno. Some fat guy\\'s sleeping with the store manager. He\\'s not even jolly, it\\'s all political.\\nMonica: So what are you gonna be?\\nJoey: Ah, I\\'m gonna be one of his helpers. It\\'s just such a slap in the face, y\\'know?\\nRachel: Hey, do you guys know what you\\'re doing for New Year\\'s?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year\\'s?\\nChandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don\\'t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I\\'m talking loud!\\nRachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I\\'ll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you wish!\\nChandler: It\\'s just that I\\'m sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.\\nAll: Yeah, okay. Alright.\\nChandler: Y\\'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.\\nAll: Woooo! Yeah!\\nRachel: Phoebe, you\\'re on.\\nPhoebe: Oh, oh, good.\\nRachel:  Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!\\nPhoebe:\\nI made a man with eyes of coal   And a smile so bewitchin\\',   How was I supposed to know   That my mom was dead in the kitchen?    La lalala la la la la lalala la la...\\nPhoebe:\\n...My mother\\'s ashes   Even her eyelashes   Are resting in a little yellow jar,   And sometimes when it\\'s breezy...\\nPhoebe:\\n...I feel a little sneezy   And now I-\\nExcuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys!  Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?\\nMax: No. No, that\\'s- that\\'s okay.\\nPhoebe: Well, c\\'mon, if it\\'s important enough to discuss while I\\'m playing, then I assume it\\'s important enough for everyone else to hear!\\nChandler:  That guy\\'s going home with a note!\\nDavid: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-\\nPhoebe: Could you speak up please?\\nDavid:  Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I\\'d ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought\\nMax: Daryl Hannah.\\nDavid: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he\\'d ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a\\nMax: Hard quality.\\nDavid: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that\\'s when you started yelling.\\nPhoebe: Okay, we\\'re gonna take a short break.\\nJoey: Hey, that guy\\'s going home with more than a note!\\nRoss: Come here, Marcel. Sit here.\\nRachel: Pheebs, I can\\'t believe he hasn\\'t kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?\\nRoss: Just a smidge.\\nPhoebe: David\\'s like, y\\'know, Scientist Guy. He\\'s very methodical.\\nMonica: I think it\\'s romantic.\\nPhoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nPhoebe: Well, he\\'s kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he\\'s smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...\\nChandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you\\'re gonna ask him to New Year\\'s, aren\\'t you. You\\'re gonna break the pact. She\\'s gonna break the pact.\\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?\\nChandler: Yeah, \\'cause I already asked Janice.\\nMonica: What?!\\nRoss: C\\'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!\\nChandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn\\'t handle the pressure and I snapped.\\nMonica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!\\nChandler: I\\'m not saying it was a good idea, I\\'m saying I snapped!\\nJoey: Hi. Hi, sorry I\\'m late.\\nChandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey!\\nJoey: Nice shoes, huh?\\nChandler: Aah, y\\'killing me!\\nMonica: Ross! He\\'s playing with my spatulas again!\\nRoss: Okay, look, he\\'s not gonna hurt them, right?\\nMonica: Do you always have to bring him here?\\nRoss: I didn\\'t wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn\\'t mean, and he- he threw some faeces...\\nChandler: Y\\'know, if you\\'re gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\\nRoss: Oh, that\\'d be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you\\'re there to see him, okay, and you\\'re not like doing it as a favour to me.\\nChandler: Okay, but if he asks, I\\'m not going to lie.\\nDavid: ...But, you can\\'t actually test this theory, because today\\'s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.\\nPhoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then.\\nDavid: Yuh.\\nPhoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?\\nDavid: Uh, that\\'s definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, \\'cause it\\'s you.\\nPhoebe: Sure.\\nDavid: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we\\'ve reached a place where it\\'s just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I\\'m not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.\\nPhoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you\\'re a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist\\'s body.\\nDavid: Rrrreally.\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I\\'m sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.\\nDavid: ...Now? Now?\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, right now.\\nDavid: Okay, okay, okay.\\nPhoebe: Okay, now you\\'re just kinda tidying.\\nDavid: Okay, what the hell, what the hell.  You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?\\nPhoebe: I can hop.\\nRoss: So tell me something. What does the phrase \\'no date pact\\' mean to you?\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, okay. It\\'s just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I\\'d ask Fun Bobby.\\nChandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nJoey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?\\nChandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.\\nRachel:  Okay, here we go...\\nJoey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there\\'s no room for milk!\\nRachel:  There. Now there is.\\nRoss: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.\\nJoey: Uh, four.\\nRoss: Four.\\nRachel: Five.\\nRoss: Five.\\nRachel: Sorry. Paolo\\'s catching an earlier flight.\\nJoey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What\\'s an elf to do?\\nRoss: Okay, so I\\'m gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?\\nRachel: Oh, c\\'mon. We\\'ll have, we\\'ll have a big party, and no-one\\'ll know who\\'s with who.\\nRoss: Hey, y\\'know, this is so not what I needed right now.\\nMonica: What\\'s the matter?\\nRoss: Oh, it\\'s-it\\'s Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y\\'know? He\\'s walking around all the time dragging his hands...\\nChandler: That\\'s so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.\\nRoss: Really.\\nChandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.\\nRoss: What, uh... what juggling thing?\\nChandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.\\nRoss: No.\\nChandler: Y\\'know, it wasn\\'t that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...\\nMax: Phoebe. Hi.\\nPhoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?\\nMax: No. Have you seen David?\\nPhoebe: No, no, he hasn\\'t been around.\\nMax: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.\\nPhoebe: Minsk?\\nMax: Minsk. It\\'s in Russia.\\nPhoebe: I know where Minsk is.\\nMax: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.\\nPhoebe: So when, when do you leave?\\nMax: January first.\\nCommercial Break\\nPhoebe: Hello?\\nDavid: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hi.\\nDavid: Hi!  What-what\\'re you doing here?\\nPhoebe: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!\\nMax: It\\'d be even more exciting if we were going.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you\\'re not going?  Oh, why?\\nMax: Tell her, David. \\'I don\\'t wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!\\'\\nDavid: Thank you, Max. Thank you.\\nPhoebe: So-so you\\'re really not going?\\nDavid: I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do.

Oh, don\\'t tell me what\\'s in it, the diet starts tomorrow!\\nChandler: You remember Janice.\\nMonica: Vividly.\\nMonica: Hi.\\nSandy: Hi, I\\'m Sandy.\\nJoey: Sandy! Hi! C\\'mon in! ...You brought your kids.\\nSandy: Yeah. That\\'s okay, right?\\nRoss: Par-tay!\\nMonica: That thing is not coming in here.\\nRoss: \\'That thing\\'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn\\'t be welcome in your home?\\nMonica: I\\'m guessing your new girlfriend wouldn\\'t urinate on my coffee table.\\nRoss: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...\\nMonica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.\\nRoss: Thank you.  Alright, I\\'ll, uh... catch up with you later.\\nMonica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where\\'s Paolo?\\nRachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.\\nPhoebe: And then... your face is bloated?\\nRachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I\\'m blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I\\'m going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?\\nSandy: Y\\'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.\\nJoey: Wow, that\\'s, uh, dirty.\\nSandy: Yeah.\\nJoey: Hey, kids...\\nRoss:  Look at him. I\\'m not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.\\nJanice:  There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!\\nChandler:  But you found me!\\nJanice: Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You\\'re on Janice Camera!\\nChandler: Kill me. Kill me now.\\nMonica: Hey everybody! It\\'s Fun Bobby!\\nFun Bobby: Hey, sorry I\\'m late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn\\'t get a flight out \\'til tomorrow, so here I am!\\nJoey:  Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?\\nFun Bobby: It\\'s gonna be an open casket, y\\'know, so at least I\\'ll- I get to see him again.\\nJanice:  Oh, I\\'m gonna blow this one up, and I\\'m gonna write \\'Reunited\\' in glitter.\\nChandler: Alright, Janice, that\\'s it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn\\'t necessarily think that it meant that we-\\nJanice: Oh, no. Oh, no.\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry you misunderstood...\\nJanice: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.\\nChandler: Oh, will you give me the thing.\\nPhoebe: Hi, Max!\\nMax: Yoko.  I\\'ve decided to go to Minsk without you.\\nDavid: Wow.\\nMax: It won\\'t be the same- but it\\'ll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.\\nPhoebe: Are you alright?\\nDavid: Yeah, I\\'m fine, I\\'m fine.\\nPhoebe: You\\'re going to Minsk.\\nDavid: No, I\\'m... not going to Minsk.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can\\'t stay here just \\'cause of me.\\nDavid: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can\\'t break up with you.\\nPhoebe: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, \\'Phoebe, my work is my life and that\\'s what I have to do right now\\'. And I say \\'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!\\'. And then you say, um, \\'it\\'s tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can\\'t you understand that?\\'. And I say  \\'no! No! I can\\'t understand that!\\'.\\nDavid: Uh, ow.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you\\'ll never forget me.\\nDavid: I\\'ll never forget you.\\nPhoebe: And then you say that it\\'s almost midnight and you have to go because you don\\'t wanna start the new year with me if you can\\'t finish it.  I\\'m gonna miss you. You scientist guy.\\nDick Clark:  Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We\\'re in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...\\nJoey: There y\\'go, kids.\\nChandler:\\nJoey: You seen Sandy?\\nChandler: Ooh.

Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.\\nRachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.\\nAll:  What?\\nRachel: The bll is drrbing!\\nDick Clark:  In twenty seconds it\\'ll be midnight...\\nChandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.\\nJoey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.\\nPhoebe: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.\\nMonica: Not everybody\\'s happy. Hey Bobby!\\nChandler: Y\\'know, I uh.. just thought I\\'d throw this out here. I\\'m no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.\\nPhoebe: I dunno. I don\\'t feel like kissing anyone tonight.\\nRachel: I can\\'t kiss anyone.\\nMonica: So I\\'m kissing everyone?\\nJoey: Nonono, you can\\'t kiss Ross, that\\'s your brother.\\nRoss: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody\\'s getting kissed but me.\\nChandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it\\'s midnight! Somebody kiss me!\\nJoey: Alrightalrightalright.  There.\\nClosing Credits\\nRoss:  I wanted this to work so much. I mean I\\'m still in there, changing his diapers, pickin\\' his fleas... but he\\'s just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn\\'t love you back.\\nRachel: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-11\\nWritten by: Alexa Junge Transcribed by: guineapig\\nPhoebe: Do you think they have yesterday\\'s daily news?\\nMonica: Why?\\nPhoebe: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.\\nMonica: Oh my God.

She\\'s always been a Freudian nightmare.\\nRoss: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don\\'t you say something?\\nChandler: Because it\\'s complicated, it\\'s complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!\\nRoss:  We\\'re rehearsing a Greek play.\\nChandler: That\\'s very funny.

Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there\\'s just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, \"How could you?\" or, \"Enormous breasts!\" Here he comes!\\nPhoebe: Ooh!\\nPaolo: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.\\nPhoebe: Oh, ok bye-bye.\\nMonica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.\\nPaolo: Grazie.\\nRoss: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...\\nPhoebe: Oh, just look at her...\\nRoss: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she\\'s not overwhelmed...\\nMonica: Oh, you\\'re right.\\nRoss:  ...and I really think it should be me.\\nRoss: Hey.\\nRachel: Hey.\\nRoss: You all right?\\nRachel: Ooh, I\\'ve been better...\\nRoss: Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.\\nRachel: Oh, Ross...\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: I am so sick of guys. I don\\'t want to look at another guy, I don\\'t want to think about another guy, I don\\'t even want to be near another guy.\\nRoss: Huh.\\nRachel: Oh Ross, you\\'re so great!\\nRoss: Ohhhh\\nMonica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?\\nRachel: Oh...\\nPhoebe: You ok?\\nRachel: ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?\\nPhoebe: Yep!\\nRoss: See, Rach, uh, see, I don\\'t think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don\\'t. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.\\nRachel: No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want\\nRoss: Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.\\nRachel: No, I know, I know, and I\\'m sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.\\nRoss:  What?\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss: I-I\\'m, I\\'m having a boy?\\nRachel: Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you\\'re not having a boy.\\nRoss: Wha-I\\'m having, I\\'m having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?\\nGirls: Yes, you\\'re having a boy!\\nRoss: I\\'m having a boy! Oh, I\\'m having a boy!\\nChandler: Wha-\\nJoey: Wha-\\nJoey and Chandler: What is it?\\nRoss: I\\'m having a boy! I-I\\'m having a boy!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nJoey and Chandler: We already knew that!\\nRoss: I\\'m having a son. Um...\\nClosing Credits\\nMonica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!\\nJoey and Chandler: Shut-out!!\\nMonica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!\\nJoey: Uh, it\\'s 2:30 in the morning!\\nChandler: Yeah, get out!\\nMonica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I\\'ll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  and I\\'m gone.\\nChandler:  One more game?\\nJoey: Oh yeah!\\nEnd\\n======== 01-13\\nWritten by: Alexa Junge Transcribed by: guineapig\\nRachel: That is it! You just barge in here, you don\\'t knock\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry!\\nRachel: You have no respect for anybody\\'s privacy!\\nChandler: Rachel, wait, wait.\\nRachel: No, you wait! This is ridiculous!\\nChandler: Can I just say one thing?\\nRachel: What? What?!\\nChandler: That\\'s a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.\\nRachel: Oh!!\\nOpening Credits\\nPhoebe: Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y\\'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.\\nRoger: That\\'s pretty much it.\\nPhoebe: Oops!\\nRoger: But you tell it really well, sweetie.\\nPhoebe: Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.\\nRoger: Okay. I\\'ll miss you.\\nPhoebe: Isn\\'t he great?\\nRachel: He\\'s so cute! And he seems to like you so much.\\nPhoebe: I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he\\'s not too shrinky, y\\'know?\\nMonica: So, you think you\\'ll do it on his couch?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know. I think that\\'s a little weird, y\\'know? Vinyl.\\nRachel: Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?\\nChandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those.\\nRachel: No, I\\'m sorry, we\\'re all out of those. Anybody else?\\nChandler: Okay.\\nRoger: Did I, uh, did I miss something?\\nChandler: No, she\\'s still upset because I saw her boobies.\\nRoss: You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?\\nChandler: It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.\\nRachel: Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, \\'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.\\nRachel: Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.\\nChandler: Y\\'know, I don\\'t know why you\\'re so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.\\nRachel: Nice? They were nice. I mean, that\\'s it? I mean, mittens are nice.\\nChandler: Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.\\nRoger: You\\'re so funny! He\\'s really funny! I wouldn\\'t wanna be there when when the laughter stops.\\nChandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What\\'d you mean by that?\\nRoger: Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y\\'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.\\nChandler: Huh.\\nRoger: I mean hey! I just met you, I don\\'t know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.\\nChandler: Uhhuh, how did you know that?\\nRoger: It\\'s textbook.\\nJoey: Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?\\nAll: Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!\\nMonica: Hey, how long are you in the city?\\nMr. Tribbiani: Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I\\'m better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  I don\\'t know this one.\\nPhoebe: Oh, this is my friend Roger.\\nRoger: Hi.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.\\nRoger: You too, sir.\\nMr. Tribbiani:  What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?\\nJoey: Dad, dad.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Oh, \\'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how\\'s the wife?  Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!\\nMr. Tribbiani: Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it\\'s getting real late now\\nJoey:  Did you know this isn\\'t Ma?\\nMr. Tribbiani: Her name\\'s Ronni. She\\'s a pet mortician.\\nJoey: Sure. So how long you been...\\nMr. Tribbiani: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?\\nJoey: Since then?!\\nMr. Tribbiani: No, it\\'s only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you\\'d know that I wasn\\'t always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y\\'ever been in love?\\nJoey: ...I d\\'know.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Then y\\'haven\\'t. You\\'re burning your tomatoes.\\nJoey: You\\'re one to talk.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Joe, your dad\\'s in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it\\'s with two different women.\\nJoey: Oh man. Please tell me one of \\'em is Ma.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Of course, course one of \\'em\\'s Ma. What\\'s the matter with you.\\nJoey: It\\'s like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He\\'s like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That\\'d be cool.... This blows!\\nRachel: I know, I mean, why can\\'t parents just stay parents?  Why can\\'t you stop staring at my breasts?\\nChandler:  What?\\nRachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?\\nRoss: Alright, alright. We\\'re all adults here, there\\'s only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you\\'re gonna have to show her your peepee.\\nChandler: Y\\'know, I don\\'t see that happening?\\nRachel: C\\'mon, he\\'s right. Tit for tat.\\nChandler: Well I\\'m not showing you my \\'tat.\\'\\nMonica: Hello?\\nPhoebe:  It\\'s Phoebe.\\nRoger:  And Rog.\\nMonica: C\\'mon up.\\nChandler:  Oh, good. Rog is here.\\nJoey: What\\'s the matter with Rog?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nChandler: Oh, it\\'s nothing, it\\'s a little thing... I hate that guy.\\nRoss: What, so he was a little analytical. That\\'s what he does, y\\'know? C\\'mon, he\\'s not that bad.\\nRoss: Y\\'see, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?\\nRoger: I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.\\nRoss: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?\\nRoger: I don\\'t know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...\\nMonica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.\\nRoger: Well, I don\\'t know. I mean, it\\'s conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.\\nRoss: That that\\'s ridiculous! I don\\'t feel guilty for her failures!\\nMonica: Oh! So you think I\\'m a failure!\\nPhoebe: Isn\\'t he good?\\nRoss: Nonono, thatthat\\'s not what I was saying...\\nMonica: Y\\'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they\\'d keep liking you better!\\nRoss: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!\\nRachel: You\\'re right! I mean you\\'re right! It wasn\\'t just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles\\' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.\\nRoger: That\\'s tough. Tough stuff. C\\'mon, Pheebs, we\\'re gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, \\'kay?\\nRoger: Geez, we\\'re gonna be late, sweetie...\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.\\nMonica: You\\'re welcome.\\nRoger: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they\\'re just food, they\\'re not love.\\nMonica: Hate that guy!\\nJoey: Night, you guys.\\nChandler: Oh look, it\\'s the woman we ordered.\\nJoey: Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?\\nRonni: Oh, no thanks, I\\'m just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.\\nJoey: I\\'m Joey Tribbiani.\\nRonni: Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you\\'re so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I\\'m, I\\'m Ronni....Cheese Nip?\\nChandler: Uh, Joey\\'s having an embolism, but I\\'d go for a Nip, y\\'know?\\nCommercial Break\\nRonni: Now, y\\'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want \\'em sorta laid out like they\\'re sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.\\nChandler: Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.\\nRonni: That\\'s a good one!\\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey, Joe.\\nJoey: Dad, Ronni\\'s here.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Huh?\\nRonni: Hi.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what\\'re what\\'re you doing here?\\nRonni: Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you\\'d need it tomorrow for your meeting.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Thank you. Uh...\\nChandler: So, who\\'s up for a big game of Kerplunk?\\nRonni: Look, I uh, I shouldn\\'ta come. I-I\\'d better get going, I don\\'t wanna miss the last train.\\nMr. Tribbiani: I don\\'t want you taking that thing.\\nRonni: Oh, where\\'m I gonna stay, here?\\nJoey: Who-ah-ho.\\nMr. Tribbiani: We\\'ll go to a hotel.\\nRonni:  We\\'ll go to a hotel.\\nJoey: No you won\\'t.\\nRonni: No we won\\'t.\\nJoey: If you go to a hotel you\\'ll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.\\nMr. Tribbiani: You\\'re gonna keep an eye on us?\\nJoey: That\\'s right, mister, and I don\\'t care how old you are, as long as you\\'re under my roof you\\'re gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.\\nRonni: Wow. He\\'s strict.\\nJoey: Now dad, you\\'ll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler\\'s room.\\nRonni: Thanks. You\\'re, uh, you\\'re a good kid.\\nChandler: C\\'mon, I\\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\\'s not followed by \"No thanks, it\\'s late.\"\\nJoey: Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.\\nMr. Tribbiani: What kinda change?\\nJoey: Well, either you break it off with Ronni\\nMr. Tribbiani: I can\\'t do that!\\nJoey: Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!\\nMr. Tribbiani: Yeah, but this is\\nJoey: I don\\'t wanna hear it! Now go to my room!\\nChandler: Hey, Kicky. What\\'re you doing?\\nJoey: Just trying to get comfortable. I can\\'t sleep in my underwear.\\nChandler: Well, you\\'re gonna.\\nJoey: I\\'ve been thinking. Y\\'know, about how I\\'m always seeing girls on top of girls...\\nChandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?\\nJoey: Y\\'know what I mean, about how I\\'m always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I\\'d be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y\\'know? Now I\\'m looking at my dad, thinking...\\nChandler: Hey, you\\'re not him. You\\'re you. When they were all over you to go into your father\\'s pipe-fitting business, did you cave?\\nJoey: No.\\nChandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn\\'t easy, but you did it! And I\\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I\\'m married.\"\\nJoey: You really think so?\\nChandler: Yeah. I really do.\\nJoey: Thanks, Chandler.\\nChandler: Get off!\\nRonni: Hi.\\nMonica: Hi...May I help you?\\nRonni: Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler\\'s in ours?\\nMonica: Okay...who are you?\\nRonni: Oh, I\\'m Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?\\nMonica: Oh, c\\'mon in.\\nRonni: Thanks.\\nRachel: Hi, I\\'m Rachel.\\nRonni: Hi.\\nRachel: Bathroom\\'s up there.\\nRonni: Great.\\nRachel: Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler\\'s been in the shower?\\nRonni: Oh, like, uh, five minutes?\\nRachel: Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it\\'s peepee time.  Hey, Mr. Trib.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Hey. Morning, dear.\\nRachel: Chandler Bing? It\\'s time to see your thing.\\nJoey:  What\\'s the matter with you?!\\nRachel: I thought it was Chandler!\\nChandler:  What? What?\\nRachel: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!\\nChandler: Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.\\nAll: Hey, Pheebs.\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nMonica: How\\'s it going?\\nPhoebe: Good. Oh oh! Roger\\'s having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.\\nPhoebe: So what\\'s going on?\\nMonica: Nothing, um, it\\'s just, um... It\\'s Roger.\\nRoss: I dunno, there\\'s just something about...\\nChandler: Basically we just feel that he\\'s...\\nRachel: We hate that guy.\\nAll: Yeah. Hate him.\\nRoss: We\\'re sorry, Pheebs, we\\'re sorry.\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don\\'t you think, maybe, though, it\\'s just that he\\'s so perceptive that it freaks you out?\\nAll: ...No, we hate him.\\nRachel: We\\'re sorry.\\nJoey: Ma! What\\'re you doing here?\\nMrs. Tribbiani: I came to give you this\\nJoey: Oww! Big ring!\\nMrs. Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father\\'s head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There\\'s chicken in there, put it away. For God\\'s sake, Joey, really.\\nJoey: Hold on, you-you knew?\\nMrs. Tribbiani: Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should\\'ve heard some of his cover stories. \"I\\'m sleeping over at my accountant\\'s,\" I mean, what is that? Please!\\nJoey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!\\nMrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he\\'s happy! I mean, it\\'s nice, he has a hobby.\\nJoey: Ma, I don\\'t mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?\\nMrs. Tribbiani: Me? I\\'m fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there\\'d be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I\\'ll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he\\'s been so ashamed of himself that he\\'s been more attentive, he\\'s been more loving... I mean, it\\'s like every day\\'s our anniversary.\\nJoey: I\\'m...happy...for you?\\nMrs. Tribbiani: Well don\\'t be, because now everything\\'s screwed up. I just want it the way it was.\\nJoey: Ma, I\\'m sorry. I just did what I thought you\\'d want.\\nMrs. Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?\\nJoey: Yeah. You\\'re ten times prettier than she is.\\nMrs. Tribbiani: That\\'s sweet. Could I take her?\\nJoey: With this ring?  No contest.\\nRoger: What\\'s wrong, sweetie?\\nPhoebe: Nothing, nothing.\\nRoger: Aaaah, what\\'s wrong, c\\'mon.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s, I mean, it\\'s nothing, I\\'m fine. It\\'s my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don\\'t.\\nRoger: Oh. They don\\'t.\\nPhoebe: But they don\\'t see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don\\'t see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you\\'re a little...\\nRoger: What?\\nPhoebe: Intense and creepy.\\nRoger: Oh.\\nPhoebe: But I don\\'t. Me, Phoebe.\\nRoger: Well, I\\'m not I\\'m not at all surprised they feel that way.\\nPhoebe: You\\'re not? See, that\\'s why you\\'re so great!\\nRoger: Actually it\\'s, it\\'s quite, y\\'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y\\'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I\\'m sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you\\'re like all \\'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!\\'.\\nMonica: So you talked to your dad, huh.\\nJoey: Yeah. He\\'s gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she\\'s gonna keep pretending she doesn\\'t know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can\\'t see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.\\nRachel: Wow.\\nChandler: Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.\\nRoss: So Joey, you okay?\\nJoey: Yeah, I guess. It\\'s just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you\\'ve gotta let them make their own mistakes.\\nRachel: Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.\\nChandler: If I turn into my parents, I\\'ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I\\'ll end up like my mom.\\nPhoebe:  Hey.\\nAll: Hey, Pheebs.\\nMonica: How\\'s it going?\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.\\nAll: Awww.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, right.\\nAll: Aaawwwwww!!\\nRachel: What happened?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know, I mean, he\\'s a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it\\'s just... I hate that guy!\\nClosing Credits\\nPhoebe: Hey, Joey. What\\'s going on?\\nJoey: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.\\nMonica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!\\nJoey: Sorry. Wrong boobies.\\nMonica: Hello, Joey.\\nMr. Tribbiani: Oh! ...Hello, dear.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-14\\nJoey: I\\'m tellin\\' you Ross, she wants you.\\nRoss: She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.\\nChandler: Any contact?\\nRoss: She lent me an egg once.\\nJoey: You\\'re in!\\nRoss: Aw, right.\\nWoman: Hi, Ross.\\nRoss: Hey.\\nChandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing\\'s not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don\\'t think we need a third...\\nJoey: Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.\\nRoss: An egg?\\nJoey: Yeah, you\\'re gonna go up to her and say, \"Here\\'s your egg back, I\\'m returning your egg.\"\\nChandler: I think it\\'s winning.\\nRoss: I think it\\'s insane.\\nChandler: She\\'ll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.\\nJoey: Think it\\'ll work?\\nChandler: No, it\\'s suicide. The man\\'s got an egg.\\nMonica: You can not do this.\\nRachel: Do what, do what?\\nMonica: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.\\nRachel: No! Phoebes! Don\\'t you remember why you dumped the guy?\\nPhoebe: \\'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it\\'s nice to have a date on Valentine\\'s Day!\\nMonica: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.\\nRachel: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?\\nJoey: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.\\nChandler: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...\\nJoey: No, no, no, don\\'t you dare bail on me. The only reason she\\'s goin\\' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.\\nChandler: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...\\nJoey: Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she\\'s needy, she\\'s vulnerable. I\\'m thinkin\\', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You\\'re doin\\' this.\\nRoss: Hi. She said yes.\\nChandler: Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?\\nJoey:  How do I look?\\nChandler: Oh, uh, I... don\\'t... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.\\nLorraine: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.\\nChandler: ...And what did you bring?\\nLorraine: She\\'s checking the coats. Joey, I\\'m gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.\\nChandler: Janice?\\nJanice: Oh.... my.... God.\\nChandler:  Hey, it\\'s Janice.\\nChandler: Ok, I\\'m makin\\' a break for it, I\\'m goin\\' out the window.\\nJoey: No, no, no, don\\'t! I\\'ve been waitin\\' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.\\nChandler: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I\\'ve dumped twice in the last five months!\\nJoey:  Can you stop yellin\\'? You\\'re makin\\' me nervous, and I can\\'t go when I\\'m nervous.\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry, you\\'re right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!\\nRachel: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.\\nMonica: Which one was Pete Carney?\\nRachel: Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  \"Was it good for you?\"\\nMonica: Yeah, well, I\\'ll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-\"I-win\"-guy.  \"I win! I win!\" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn\\'t get to win once.\\nRachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We\\'re good people!\\nMonica: I don\\'t know. Maybe we\\'re some kinda magnets.\\nPhoebe: I know I am. That\\'s why I can\\'t wear a digital watch.\\nMonica: There\\'s more beer, right?\\nPhoebe: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.\\nRachel: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.\\nPhoebe: Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It\\'s Valentine\\'s Day. It\\'s perfect.\\nMonica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?\\nPhoebe: Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.\\nRachel: Or?\\nPhoebe: Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.\\nMonica: Burning\\'s good.\\nRachel: Burning\\'s good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.\\nLorraine: You know, ever since I was little, I\\'ve been able to pick up quarters with my toes.\\nJoey: Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?\\nJanice: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.\\nChandler: That\\'s OK.\\nJanice: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.\\nJoey:  We can\\'t do that.\\nChandler:  What? What can\\'t you do?\\nJoey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?\\nJoey: Uh, we might be leaving now.\\nChandler: Tell me it\\'s \"you and me\" we.\\nJoey: She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I\\'m not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.\\nChandler: Ok, you can not do this to me.\\nJoey: You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. You\\'re right.\\nLorraine:  Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?\\nJoey: I\\'m outta here. Here\\'s my credit card. Dinner\\'s on me. I\\'m sorry, Chandler.\\nChandler: I hope she throws up on you.\\nChandler: So...\\nJanice: Just us.\\nChandler: Oh, what a crappy night!\\nJanice: Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt\\'s been stickin\\' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.\\nChandler: Excuse me.  How ya doin\\'?\\nJanice: So, do we have the best friends or what?\\nChandler: Joey\\'s not a friend. He\\'s...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?\\nJanice: I will go for that drink.\\nChandler: You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?\\nJanice: Each.\\nChandler: That\\'s right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I\\'ve always wanted to know...\\nJanice: Happy Valentine\\'s Day!\\nJanice: Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?\\nChandler: No... no! And yet it did.

I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.\\nSusan: I thought they could...I\\'ll try to get back as soon as I can. I\\'m sorry.\\nRoss: Now that is funny.

At least there\\'s no new way for me to tell you this. I just don\\'t things are gonna work out.\\nJanice: That\\'s fine.\\nChandler:  It is?\\nJanice: Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn\\'t the end.\\nChandler: Oh no, you see, actually it is.\\nJanice: No, it isn\\'t, because you won\\'t let that happen. Don\\'t you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.\\nChandler: Oh, no I don\\'t.\\nJanice: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year\\'s? Who invited who? Valentine\\'s? Who asked who into whose bed?\\nChandler: I did, but...\\nJanice: You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can\\'t live without me. And you know it. You just don\\'t know you know it. See ya.\\nChandler: Call me!\\nCarol: It\\'s not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.\\nRoss: You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?\\nCarol: Uh, I don\\'t think she\\'s in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.\\nRoss: Well maybe it\\'s cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.\\nCarol: That could be it.\\nRoss: Oh, god.\\nCarol: Mushroom. Smile. They won\\'t all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that\\'s not funny\\nRoss: No, it\\'s just...you know the whole \"getting on with your life\" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I\\'m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she\\'s perfectly nice, and, but that there\\'s, that\\'s it. And um, and then I\\'m here talkin\\' to you, and, and it\\'s easy, and it\\'s fun, and, and I don\\'t, I don\\'t have to...You know, here\\'s a wacky thought. Um, what\\'s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you\\'re gonna say, you\\'re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let\\'s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we\\'re great together, you know. You can\\'t deny it. Besides, you\\'re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin\\' that, but there\\'s somethin\\' right here. I love you.\\nCarol: Oh, I love you too. But...\\nRoss: No but, no but.\\nCarol: You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It\\'s time to take the pin out. You\\'ll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.\\nRoss: That\\'s easy for you to say, you found one already.\\nCarol: All you need is a woman who likes men and you\\'ll be set.\\nCarol: Not her.\\nFireman No. 3: We get off around midnight, why don\\'t we pick you up then?\\nRachel: So, um, will you bring the truck?\\nFireman No. 3: I\\'ll even let you ring the bell.\\nRachel: Oh, my god.\\nPhoebe: See, there you go, the cleansing works!\\nMonica: They\\'re nice guys.\\nRachel: Oh, they\\'re firemen guys.\\nFireman No. 1: You guys tell them you were married?\\nFireman No. 2: No way!\\nFireman No. 3: Are you kidding?

And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.\\nMrs. Tedlock: Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.\\nChandler: Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.\\nPhoebe: Hey you guys! Chandler\\'s coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...\\nChandler: Hey!\\nAll: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Never mind. But it was going to be really good.\\nRoss: What\\'s going on?\\nAll: What is it?\\nChandler: So, it\\'s a typical day at work. I\\'m inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.\\nAll: That\\'s great!\\nChandler: So.... I quit.\\nAll: Why?\\nChandler: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!\\nMonica: Yeah, Chandler... you\\'ve been there for five years.\\nChandler: If I took this promotion, it\\'d be like admitting that this is what I actually do.\\nPhoebe: So was it a lot more money?\\nChandler: It doesn\\'t matter. I just don\\'t want to be one of those guys that\\'s in his office until twelve o\\'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.\\nRachel: ... the WENUS?\\nChandler: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.\\nRachel:  Oh. That WENUS.\\nJoey: So what\\'re you going to do?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know. That\\'s the thing. I don\\'t know what I want to do.

Anyway, he\\'s opening up a restaurant and he\\'s looking for a head chef.\\nMonica:  Um... hi there.\\nPhoebe: Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You\\'re a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler\\'s the one who needs a job right now, so....\\nChandler: Yeah... I just don\\'t have that much cheffing experience. Unless it\\'s an all-toast restaurant.\\nPhoebe:  Yeah, yeah!\\nMonica: Well, what kind of food is he looking for?\\nPhoebe: Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he\\'s looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.\\nMonica:  Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?\\nChandler: Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don\\'t really see myself in a big white hat.\\nPhoebe: OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what!\\nChandler: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?\\nRachel: No. But don\\'t worry, I\\'m sure they\\'re still there.\\nPhoebe: Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?\\nChandler: Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the \"a-gogo.\"\\nRachel: Career counselor?\\nChandler: Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.\\nRachel: I don\\'t!\\nChandler: Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do.

Brian\\'s Song!\\nRachel: The meeting with the guy went great?\\nMonica: So great! He showed me where the restaurant\\'s going to be. It\\'s this, it\\'s this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.\\nChandler: Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?\\nMonica: So anyway, I\\'m cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can \\'ooh\\' and \\'ahh\\' and make yummy noises.\\nRachel: What are you going to make?\\nPhoebe:  Yummy noises.\\nRachel:  And Monica, what are you going to make?\\nMonica: I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. It\\'s just going to be so great!\\nPhoebe: Ooh! I know what you could make!\\nRoss: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?\\nJoey: How about Tony\\'s? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it\\'s free.\\nRoss: OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you\\'re not dating a puma?\\nChandler: Who are you going out with?\\nPhoebe: Oh, is this the bug lady?\\nRachel:  Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.\\nRoss: Her name is Celia. She\\'s not a bug lady. She\\'s curator of insects at the museum.\\nRachel: So what are you guys going to do?\\nRoss: Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I\\'d introduce her to my monkey.\\nChandler: And he\\'s not speaking metaphorically.\\nJoey:  huh-huh?\\nRoss: Well, I don\\'t know....  huh-huh.\\nJoey: I\\'m telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She\\'s going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it\\'ll seal the deal.\\nRoss: Celia, don\\'t worry! Don\\'t scream! He\\'s not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...\\nCelia: I can\\'t stand this! He\\'s got his claws in my...\\nRoss: Alright...\\nMonica:  OK, try this salmon mousse.\\nJoey:  Mmmm. Good.\\nMonica: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?\\nJoey: It\\'s creamier.\\nMonica: Yeah, well, is that better?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know. We\\'re talking about whipped fish, Monica. I\\'m just happy I\\'m keeping it down, y\\'know?\\nRachel: My God! What happened to you?\\nChandler: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  \"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.\"\\nPhoebe: That\\'s so great! \\'Cause you already know how to do that!\\nChandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don\\'t I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.\\nRachel:  Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!\\nMonica:  Here you go, maybe this\\'ll cheer you up.\\nChandler: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I\\'d better split this with you.\\nMonica: It\\'s supposed to be that small. It\\'s a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.\\nChandler:  Well.... it is amouz-ing...\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe: Ten dollars an hour for what?\\nMonica: Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she\\'d help me out.\\nRachel:  Waitressing?\\nJoey: Uh-oh.\\nMonica: Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...\\nRachel: But, but?\\nMonica: But, you see, it\\'s just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy\\'s more of a... professional waitress.\\nRachel: Oh! I see. And I\\'ve sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.\\nChandler: You know, I don\\'t mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in \\'76.\\nCelia: Talk to me.\\nRoss: OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...\\nCelia: No no no.

She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn\\'t a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.\\nJoey:  Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??\\nRoss: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don\\'t think I\\'m the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?\\nJoey: What\\'s the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I\\'ll tell you what. Just try something on me.\\nRoss:  Please be kidding.\\nJoey: Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you\\'d like to be doing right now.\\nRoss: OK.  I\\'m in my apartment...\\nJoey: ....yeah... what else?\\nRoss: That\\'s it. I\\'m in my apartment, you\\'re not there, we\\'re not having this conversation.\\nJoey:  Alright, look, I\\'ll start, OK?\\nRoss: Joey, please.\\nJoey: Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh...

Now tell me you want to caress my butt!\\nRoss: OK, turn around.  I just don\\'t want you staring at me when I\\'m doing this.\\nJoey:  Alright, alright. I\\'m around. Go ahead.\\nRoss: Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.\\nJoey: There you go! Keep going. Keep going!\\nRoss: I, er...\\nRoss: I want to take my tongue... and...\\nRoss: ....and....\\nJoey: Say it... say it!\\nRoss: ...run it all over your body until you\\'re... trembling with... with...\\nChandler: ....with??\\nRoss:  Funny story!\\nJoey: You\\'re not going to believe this!\\nChandler: It\\'s OK. It\\'s OK.

And again.\\nChandler:\\nChandler: Well?\\nPhoebe:  Wow! It\\'s huge! It\\'s so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.\\nChandler: Look at this!\\nPhoebe: Oh!

Can I help you with anything?\\nSteve: You know, I don\\'t know what I\\'m looking for.\\nSteve:  You know, these are... they\\'re like a little corn envelope.\\nMonica:  You know that? You don\\'t want to spoil your appetite.\\nSteve:\\nMonica: You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...\\nSteve: Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!\\nMonica: No, we don\\'t.\\nSteve: Oh, OK.\\nMonica: Why don\\'t you just have a seat here?

I\\'m drowning!  Help!\"\\nMonica:  That\\'s it! Dinner is over!\\nSteve: What?\\nMonica: What?\\nSteve: Why?\\nMonica: Why? It\\'s just that I\\'ve waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can\\'t even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?\\nSteve:  Hey!\\nJoey: What a tool!\\nRachel: You don\\'t want to work for a guy like that.\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nMonica: I know... it\\'s just... I thought this was, you know... it.\\nRoss: Look, you\\'ll get there. You\\'re an amazing chef.\\nPhoebe: Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn\\'t faking.\\nJoey:  So, er... how did it go with Celia?\\nRoss: Oh, I was unbelievable.\\nJoey: All right, Ross!\\nRoss: I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.\\nJoey: Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?\\nRoss: Well, ahem... you know, by the time we\\'d finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...\\nJoey: You cuddled.\\nRoss: Yeah, which was nice.\\nPhoebe: You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?\\nRachel: Maybe, but shouldn\\'t we wait for Chandler?\\nJoey: Yeah, where the hell is he?\\nChandler:  Whooooaaaa....\\nPhoebe: How\\'s this?\\nSteve: Eeeee!\\nPhoebe: Sorry.

I\\'m done with men!\\' The whole, uh, penis embargo?\\nRachel: Oh, I don\\'t know. I guess it\\'s not about no guys, it\\'s about the right guy, y\\'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that\\'s all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...\\nRoss: Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.\\nRachel: Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y\\'know? Someone who\\'s like, who\\'s like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?\\nRoss: Yes. Yes. Yes!

I\\'m, like, in disbelief.\\nChandler: I mean, don\\'t you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would\\'ve happened already?\\nRoss: I\\'m telling you, she said she\\'s looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.\\nJoey: She really said that?\\nRoss: Well, I added the \\'exactly like me\\' part... But she said she\\'s looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.\\nJoey: \\'Tonight\\' tonight?\\nRoss: Well, I think it\\'s perfect. Y\\'know, it\\'s just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...\\nChandler: I can\\'t remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.\\nRoss: Anyway, I figured after work I\\'d go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.\\nChandler: Hey, y\\'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890\\'s, when that phrase was last used.\\nRachel: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that\\'s Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there\\'s Raven. We hate her. We\\'re glad she\\'s dying. Okay-\\nJoey: How could you lose him?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica\\'s shoe-\\nMonica: Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know. The left one.\\nMonica: Which ones?\\nRachel: Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.\\nPhoebe:  Hey.\\nAll: Hi.\\nPhoebe: Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?\\nChandler: Rachel lost Marcel.\\nPhoebe: Oh no, how?\\nMonica: He- he pooped in my shoe.\\nPhoebe: Which one?\\nMonica: Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.\\nPhoebe: No, which one?

I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.\\nRachel: I know, I know, I\\'m sorry-\\nRoss: No, y\\'know what, I guess it\\'s partially my fault. Y\\'know, I shouldn\\'t\\'ve, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should\\'ve started you off with like a pen or a pencil.\\nRachel:  Oh! Who is it?\\nIntercom: Animal Control.\\nRachel: See? I\\'ve even called Animal Control!\\nRoss: You called Animal Control?\\nRachel: Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?\\nRoss: Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I\\'m not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they\\'ll take him away from me.\\nRachel: O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...\\nRoss: That\\'s right, I.. \\'cause I didn\\'t expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!\\nRachel: Hi, thanks for coming.\\nLuisa:  Somebody called about a monkey?\\nRachel: Oh, y\\'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!\\nRoss: Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn\\'t.\\nRachel: Turned out it was a hat.\\nRoss: Cat!\\nRachel: Cat! What\\'m I saying? Cat!\\nMonica: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one\\'s seen Marcel.\\nLuisa: Marcel?\\nRoss: My uncle Marcel.\\nPhoebe: Oh, is that who the monkey\\'s named after?\\nLuisa: Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?\\nPhoebe: Oh my God. You\\'d put that poor little creature in jail?\\nMonica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?\\nPhoebe: Yes, but there isn\\'t always time!\\nMonica: Look.

It\\'s Luisa!\\nMonica: The Luisa from home room!\\nRachel: Yes!!\\nLuisa: You have no idea who I am, do you.\\nMonica: No, none at all.\\nRachel: None.\\nLuisa: Well, maybe that\\'s because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say \\'Morning, Luisa\\'? Or \\'Nice overalls\\'?\\nMonica: Oh, I\\'m- I\\'m so sorry!\\nLuisa: Ah, it\\'s not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.  But you? What a bitch!\\nRachel: What?!\\nMonica: Be that as it may, d\\'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y\\'know, just for old times\\' sake?

And they\\'re very hot.\\nJoey: We can\\'t, alright?  We\\'re sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we\\'d find this monkey. If you see him, he\\'s about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you\\'d really be helping us out.\\nChandler: Okay, from now on, you don\\'t get to talk to other people.\\nJoey: Marcel?\\nChandler: Marcel?!\\nPhoebe: Marcel?\\nMonica: Marcel?\\nPhoebe: Marcel?\\nBoth: Marcel?\\nPhoebe: Oh-my-God!\\nMonica: Whaaat!\\nPhoebe: Something just brushed up against my right leg!\\nMonica: What is it?\\nPhoebe: Oh, it\\'s okay, it was just my left leg.\\nMonica: Look, Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: Yeah!

I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.\\nRachel: Ross, I said I\\'m sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I\\'m gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!\\nRoss: Yeah, yeah. Y\\'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don\\'t miss Marcel any more!\\nRachel: Y\\'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.\\nRoss: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you\\'re off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people\\'s monkeys, or to people\\'s feelings...\\nRachel: Ross.\\nRoss: I don\\'t even wanna hear it, you\\'re just...\\nRachel: Ross.\\nRoss: Oh, forget it, okay?\\nRachel: Ross!\\nRoss: What? What?\\nBoth: Hey! Hey, Bananaman!\\nPhoebe: Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.\\nRoss: Hi, did you order some bananas?\\nMr. Heckles: What about it?\\nRoss: Gimme back my monkey.\\nMr. Heckles: I don\\'t have a monkey.\\nRachel: Then what\\'s with all the bananas?\\nMr. Heckles: Potassium.\\nRoss: Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?\\nRoss: Marcel! What\\'ve you done to him?\\nMr. Heckles: That\\'s my monkey. That\\'s Patti, Patti the monkey.\\nRoss: Are you insane? C\\'mere, Marcel, c\\'mon.\\nMr. Heckles: C\\'mere, Patti.\\nRoss: C\\'mere, Marcel.\\nMr. Heckles: C\\'mere, Patti.\\nLuisa:  Gotcha.\\nRoss: Okay, gimme my monkey back.\\nMr. Heckles: That\\'s my monkey.\\nLuisa: You\\'re both gonna have to take this up with the judge.\\nMr. Heckles: That\\'s not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.\\nRoss: Alright, I want my monkey.\\nLuisa: No!\\nRachel: Oh, c\\'mon, Luisa!\\nLuisa: Sorry, prom queen.\\nRoss:  You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn\\'t\\'ve been fat.\\nRachel: Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C\\'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!\\nLuisa: Nope.\\nRachel: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?\\nRoss: It\\'ll be nice to get this off finally, won\\'t it? Yes it will.  Or we can leave it on for now, that\\'s fine.\\nRachel: Y\\'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.\\nRoss: Listen, I\\'m- I\\'m sorry I was so hard on you before, it\\'s just I...\\nRachel: Oh, Ross, c\\'mon. It\\'s my fault, I almost lost your...\\nRoss: Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y\\'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?\\nRachel: That\\'d be good.\\nRoss: Alright.  Well, so long as we\\'re here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...\\nBarry: Rachel.\\nRachel: Barry?!\\nBarry: I can\\'t. I can\\'t do it, I can\\'t marry Mindy. I think I\\'m still in love with you.\\nRoss and Rachel: Oh!\\nRoss: We have got to start locking that door!\\nClosing Credits\\nMonica: This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?\\nPhoebe: Nope.\\nMonica: That\\'s because I\\'m in front of them.\\nChandler: Eh. I thought that was an alp.\\nMonica: Well, high school was not my favourite time.\\nJoey: I dunno, I loved high school. Y\\'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.\\nChandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would\\'ve involved a major lifestyle choice.\\nMonica: Gosh, doesn\\'t it seem like a million years ago?\\nPhoebe: Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!\\nEnd\\n======== 01-20\\nWritten by: Doty Abrams Transcribed by: guineapig\\nChandler: I can\\'t believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.\\nJoey: No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he\\'s got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.\\nRoss: I don\\'t know, you don\\'t wanna mess with corn nuts. They\\'re craaazy.\\nMonica:  Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There\\'s some creep out there with a telescope!\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe it! He\\'s looking right at us!\\nRachel: Oh, that is so sick.\\nChandler: I feel violated. And not in a good way.\\nPhoebe: How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!\\nOpening Credits\\nChandler: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn\\'t have to play any games...\\nMonica: So have you called her yet?\\nChandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  I\\'m right, right?\\nJoey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.\\nPhoebe: Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!\\nChandler: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.\\nJoey: Her answer machine?\\nChandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.\\nPhoebe: So, uh, why didn\\'t you say anything?\\nChandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o.\"\\nMonica: Look look! It\\'s Rachel and Barry. No, don\\'t everybody look at once!\\nRoss: Okay, okay, what\\'s going on?\\nPhoebe: Okay, they\\'re just talking...\\nRoss: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?\\nPhoebe: No, no actually, he\\'s smiling.. and... Oh my God, don\\'t do that!!\\nRoss: What? What? What?!\\nPhoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!\\nChandler:  And basically, that\\'s how a bill becomes a law.\\nAll: Oh!... Right!\\nChandler: Hey Rach!\\nMonica: How\\'d it go?\\nRachel: Y\\'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y\\'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...\\nPhoebe: Not a good day for birds...\\nRachel: Then we took a walk down to Bendall\\'s, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...\\nRoss: That\\'s nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?\\nRachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y\\'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!\\nRoss: That\\'s, that\\'s nice twice!\\nMonica: Rachel, what\\'s going on? I mean isn\\'t this the same Barry who you left at the altar?\\nJoey: Duh, where\\'ve you been?\\nRachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn\\'t, like, Orthodontist Guy, y\\'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?\\nChandler: Yes!\\nRachel: Why?\\nChandler: I have my reasons.\\nMonica: Okay, how about the fact that he\\'s engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?\\nRachel: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it\\'s stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!\\nRachel: Wow... Wow!\\nBarry: Yeah.\\nRachel: I\\'m not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.\\nBarry: Nooo, it wasn\\'t.\\nRachel: Ooh, and it\\'s so nice having this little sink here...\\nChandler:  Oh God!\\nMonica: That\\'s what you\\'ve been working on for the past two hours?!\\nChandler: Hey, I\\'ve been honing!\\nRoss: What was with the dishes?\\nChandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y\\'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven\\'t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.\\nMonica:  Look look! He\\'s doing it again, the guy with the telescope!\\nPhoebe: Oh my God!  Stop looking in here!\\nMonica: Great, now he\\'s waving back.\\nJoey: Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can\\'t do stuff!\\nMonica: What kinda stuff?\\nJoey: Will you grow up? I\\'m not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I\\'m cooking naked.\\nPhoebe: You cook naked?\\nJoey: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.\\nChandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn\\'t know that.\\nBarry: What\\'s the matter?\\nRachel: Oh, it\\'s just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.\\nBarry: No, it was. It was very very good.\\nRachel: Well, what about Mindy?\\nBarry: Oh, way, way better than Mindy.\\nRachel: No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?\\nBarry: Well, if you want, I\\'ll justI\\'ll just break it off with her.\\nRachel: No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don\\'t do that. Not, I mean not for me.\\nBernice:  Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.\\nBarry:  Let\\'s go away this weekend.\\nRachel: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..\\nBarry: We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would\\'ve liked it.\\nRachel: I had a bra.\\nBobby: Hey, Dr. Farber.\\nBarry: All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we\\'re starting to see some real progress here.\\nRachel: What?!\\nBobby: I\\'m twelve, I\\'m not stupid.\\nChandler: Can I use your phone?\\nMonica: Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.\\nChandler: Yes, it\\'s working! Why isn\\'t she calling me back?\\nJoey: Maybe she never got your message.\\nPhoebe: Y\\'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn\\'t get her messages yet.\\nChandler: Y\\'don\\'t think that makes me seem a little...\\nRoss: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?\\nChandler: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.\\nPhoebe: How many beeps?\\nChandler: She answered.\\nMonica: Y\\'see, this is where you\\'d use that \\'hello\\' word we talked about.\\nChandler: I\\'m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I\\'m needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.\\nAll: Hey! Hi!\\nPhoebe: How\\'d he take it?\\nRachel: Pretty well, actually...\\nMonica:  Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?\\nRachel: Oh, do I?\\nMonica: Uh huh.\\nRachel:  We ended up having sex in his chair.\\nMonica: You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn\\'t I?\\nRoss: You-you had what?\\nPhoebe: Sex in his chair.\\nRoss: What, uh... what were you thinking?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know! I mean, we still care about each other. There\\'s a history there. \\'S\\'like you and Carol.\\nRoss: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!\\nRachel: Please. If she said to you, \"Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,\" what would you say?\\nChandler: If it helps, I could slide over.\\nRoss: It\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s, uh, a totally diferent situation! It\\'s, it\\'s apples and oranges, it\\'s, it\\'s orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.\\nPhoebe: Where are you going?\\nRoss:  I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?\\nChandler: Hello? Hello?\\nRachel:  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.\\nChandler: So how\\'s Mindy?\\nRachel: Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry...  Hi, it\\'s me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that\\'s where you\\'d be!\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: Brrrrrrr!\\nChandler: Hell is filled with people like you.\\nJoey:  He\\'s back! The peeper\\'s back!\\nJoey:  Get down!\\nRachel: Get down?\\nChandler: ...And boogie!\\nRachel: Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.\\nMonica: Relax. Y\\'know, she may not even know.\\nRachel: Please. I haven\\'t heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..\\nJoey:  Yeah?\\nRachel: And now, y\\'know, I\\'m like... I\\'m like the other woman! I feel so..\\nJoey: ..Naughty!\\nRachel: Right, I\\'ll see you guys later...\\nJoey: Oh, hold up, I\\'ll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That\\'s fine, yeah...\\nChandler: Okay, I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?\\nMonica: Why don\\'t you just take it with you?\\nChandler: Hey, we haven\\'t been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?\\nMonica: Why don\\'t you just call her?\\nChandler: I can\\'t call her, I left a message! I have some pride.\\nMonica: Do you?\\nChandler: No!  She\\'s on the other line, she\\'s gonna call me back, she\\'s on the other line, gonna call me back...\\nMonica: Don\\'t you have to pee?\\nChandler: \\'S\\'why I\\'m dancing...\\nRachel: Mindy.\\nMindy: Hey, you.\\nRachel: Hey, you.... So, what\\'s up?\\nMindy: Um.. we should really be sitting for this.\\nRachel: Sure we should... So.\\nMindy: Now, I know things\\'ve been weird lately, but you\\'re like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don\\'t talk to anywhere, \\'cause she\\'s all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn\\'t have a pretty face. ....Okay, I\\'m just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.\\nRachel: Okay.\\nMindy: Will you be my maid of honour?\\nRachel: Of course!\\nMindy: Oh that\\'s so great!\\nRachel: Was that all you wanted to ask me?\\nMindy: That\\'s all!\\nRachel: Ohhhh!!  ...What? What?\\nMindy: That\\'s not all.\\nRachel: Oh sure it is!\\nMindy: Oh no, it isn\\'t! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.\\nRachel: Um, what- what would make you think that?\\nMindy: Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he\\'s been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.\\nRachel:  Really. Mindy, if it\\'ll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.\\nMindy: Oh God! You see, that\\'s what I was afraid of!\\nRachel: What? What\\'s what you were afraid of?\\nMindy: Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.\\nRachel: What?\\nMindy: I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said \"Don\\'t do it, he\\'s just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,\" and now I feel so stupid.\\nRachel: Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.\\nMindy: What do you mean?\\nRachel:  Smell familiar?\\nMindy: Oh no.\\nRachel: Oh, I am so sorry.\\nMindy: No me, I am so sorry...\\nJoey:  Oh my.\\nRoss: Four letters: \"Circle or hoop\".\\nChandler: Ring dammit, ring!\\nRoss: Thanks.\\nJoey:  Hey, you know our phone\\'s not working?\\nChandler: What?!\\nJoey: I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.\\nChandler:  I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!\\nMonica: Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.\\nJoey: Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper\\'s name! Can I use the phone?\\nChandler: Nngghhh!!!!!!!\\nJoey:  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.\\nRoss: \"Heating device.\"\\nPhoebe: Radiator.\\nRoss: Five letters.\\nPhoebe: Rdtor.\\nJoey:  Sidney\\'s a woman.\\nMonica: So she\\'s a woman! So what?\\nJoey: Yeah. Yeah, so what?  Mostly free weights, but occasionally..\\nMonica: Joey!!\\nJoey:  She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.\\nMonica: The green dress? Really?\\nJoey: Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.\\nMonica:  Nooo!\\nRachel: Hey. Got a second?\\nBarry: Sure, sure. Come on...  ...in...\\nMindy: Hello, sweetheart.\\nBarry: Uh... uh... what\\'re\\'you... what\\'re\\'you guys doing here?\\nRachel: Uh, we are here to break up with you.\\nBarry: Both of you?\\nMindy: Basically, we think you\\'re a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.\\nBarry: I\\'m sorry... I\\'m sorry, God, I am so sorry, I\\'m an idiot, I was weak, I couldn\\'t help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!\\nRachel: Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?\\nBarry: ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.\\nRachel: Even when we were having sex in that chair?\\nBarry:  I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.\\nRachel: Please! During that second time you couldn\\'t have picked her out of a lineup!\\nMindy:  You did it twice?\\nRachel: Well, the first time didn\\'t really count... I mean, y\\'know, \\'s\\'Barry.\\nMindy: Okay...\\nBarry:  Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we\\'ll start all over again. We\\'ll go back to Aruba.\\nBernice:  Dr. Farber, we\\'ve got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.\\nBarry: Oh God...  Look, please, please don\\'t go anywhere, okay? I\\'ll be, I\\'ll be right back.\\nRachel: Okay. Okay, we\\'ll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I\\'m hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I\\'m telling you, this feels great.\\nMindy: Yeah... I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m still gonna marry him.\\nRachel: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He\\'s Satan in a smock!\\nMindy: Look, I know he\\'s not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.\\nRachel: Oh God.\\nMindy: I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you\\'ll still be my maid of honor...?\\nRachel: And I hope Barry doesn\\'t kill you and eat you in Aruba.\\nMonica: You okay?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nMonica: Really?\\nRachel: Yeah! Y\\'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.\\nMonica: Aww...\\nJoey: Big day.\\nClosing Credits\\nJoey: All right, I\\'ll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he\\'s got the monocle, he\\'s got the top hat...\\nPhoebe: You know he\\'s gay?\\nRoss: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?\\nDanielle:  Chandler?\\nChandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.\\nAll: Hi. Hi.\\nChandler: What are you doing here?\\nDanielle: Well, I\\'ve been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I\\'d just come down here, and make sure you were okay.\\nChandler: ...I\\'m, I\\'m okay.\\nDanielle: Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?\\nChandler: That sounds good. I\\'ll call you- or you call me, whatever...\\nDanielle: You got it.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nDanielle: G\\'bye, everybody.\\nAll: Bye.\\nPhoebe: Whoo-hoo!\\nMonica: Yeah, there you go!\\nRoss: Second date!\\nChandler: ...I dunno.\\nRachel: You don\\'t know?!\\nChandler: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?\\nEnd\\n======== 01-21\\nWritten by: Adam Chase and Ira Ungerleider Transcribed by guineapig\\nJoey: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?\\nMonica: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!\\nRachel: Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.\\nMonica: I know. It\\'s just such reckless spending.\\nRoss: I think when someone steals your credit card, they\\'ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind.\\nChandler: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.\\nMonica: That\\'s me.\\nPhoebe: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he\\'s doing it again!\\nRoss: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-\\nRachel: Oh no, not in my room! I\\'ll get him.\\nMonica: Ross, you\\'ve got to do something about the humping.\\nRoss: What? It\\'s, it\\'s just a phase.\\nChandler: Well, that\\'s what we said about Joey...\\nRoss: Would you all relax? It\\'s not that big a deal.\\nRachel:  Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Let\\'s just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.\\nOpening Credits\\nRachel: Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.\\nMonica: This woman\\'s living my life.\\nRachel: What?\\nMonica: She\\'s living my life, and she\\'s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I\\'m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.\\nRachel: You\\'re not an artist.\\nMonica: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don\\'t.\\nRachel: Oh, Monica, c\\'mon, you do cool things.\\nMonica: Oh really? Okay, let\\'s compare, shall we.\\nRachel:  Oh, it\\'s so late for \\'Shall we\\'...\\nMonica: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?\\nRachel:  Nooo...\\nMonica: This is so unfair! She\\'s got everything I want, and she doesn\\'t have my mother.\\nChandler: How about Joey... Pepponi?\\nJoey: No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that\\'s more neutral.\\nChandler: Joey... Switzerland?\\nJoey: Plus, y\\'know, I think it should be Joe. Y\\'know, Joey makes me sound like I\\'m, I dunno, this big.  Which I\\'m not.\\nChandler: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?\\nJoey: Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.\\nChandler: Well, it does not ring a bell with me...\\nJoey:  Joe Stalin. Y\\'know, that\\'s pretty good.\\nChandler: Might wanna try Joseph.\\nJoey: Joseph Stalin. I think you\\'d remember that!\\nChandler: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.\\nRachel: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nMonica: Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I\\'m taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.\\nPhoebe: What are you doing?\\nMonica:  I\\'m going to tap class.\\nRachel: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?\\nMonica: This woman\\'s got my life, I should get to see who she is.\\nRachel: Go to the post office! I\\'m sure her picture\\'s up! ...Okay, Monica, y\\'know what, honey, you\\'re kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.\\nPhoebe: This is madness. It\\'s madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don\\'t do it!! ...Thank you.\\nMonica: What d\\'you think?\\nPhoebe: Lotsa things.\\nRachel: Which one do you think she is?\\nTeacher: May I help you?\\nMonica: Oh, no thanks, we\\'re just here to observe.\\nTeacher: You don\\'t observe a dance class. You dance\\nRachel: What does she mean?\\nPhoebe: I think she means  \\'You dance\\nMonica: Okay, d\\'y\\'see anybody you think could be me?\\nTeacher:  People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let\\'s not have that happen again!\\nRachel: She could be you.\\nTeacher: Let\\'s get started.

You just click when they click.\\nTeacher: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.\\nPhoebe: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I\\'m with Rachel.\\nMonica: Great. It\\'s gym class all over again.\\nPhoebe and Rachel: Aww.\\nTeacher: Well that\\'s all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.\\nMonica: Why don\\'t I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.\\nWoman: It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, I\\'m here, I\\'m here.

Apparently he\\'s reached sexual maturity.\\nJoey:  Hey! He beat ya.\\nRoss: She says as time goes on, he\\'s gonna start getting agressive and violent.\\nChandler: So what does this mean?\\nRoss: I\\'m gonna have to give him up.\\nCommercial Break\\nJoey: I can\\'t believe it, Ross. This sucks!\\nChandler: I don\\'t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?\\nRoss: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he\\'s this little thing, and before you know it, he\\'s this little thing I can\\'t get off my leg.\\nJoey: Isn\\'t there any way you can keep him?\\nRoss: No, no. The vet says unless he\\'s in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,\\' he\\'s just gonna get vicious. I\\'ve just gotta get him into a zoo.\\nJoey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?\\nChandler: I know that one! ...No, that\\'s Popes into a Volkswagen.\\nRoss: Well, we\\'re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y\\'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y\\'know, he\\'s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that\\'s a possibility.\\nChandler: Yeah, but that\\'s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it\\'s a total party zoo.\\nPhoebe: Hey. We found her, we found the girl.\\nChandler: What?\\nJoey: Did you call the cops?\\nRachel: Nope. We took her to lunch.\\nChandler: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.\\nRoss: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She\\'s a stealer.\\nMonica: Y\\'know what? After you\\'re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.\\nRoss: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.\\nChandler: ...Take off their hats!\\nPhoebe: Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.\\nRachel: No way. No way did you do this.\\nFake Monica: Monana was very brave.\\nMonica: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!\\nFake Monica: So once they caught on to the fact that we\\'re, y\\'know, short and have breasts...\\nMonica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!\\nRachel: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don\\'t know. Don\\'t wait up.\\nFake Monica: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we\\'re auditioning for a Broadway show.\\nMonica: \\'Scuse me?\\nFake Monica: There\\'s an open call for Cats. I\\'m thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?\\nMonica: Nononononono. Think who you\\'re dealing with here. I mean, I\\'m not like you. I-I can\\'t even stand in front of a tap class.\\nFake Monica: Well, that\\'s just probably \\'cause of your Amish background.\\nMonica: What?\\nFake Monica: Well, you\\'re Pennsylvania Dutch, right?\\nMonica: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.\\nFake Monica: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets\\' Society?\\nMonica: Uh-huh.\\nFake Monica: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can\\'t be in the play? What was that?! It\\'s like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, \\'Now, that\\'s two hours of my life that I\\'m never getting back.\\' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.\\nMonica: Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.\\nRoss:  That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don\\'t know who this is harder on, me or him.\\nPhoebe: I\\'d say that chair\\'s taking the brunt.\\nRoss: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?\\nRachel: Oh, somebody will.\\nJoey:  You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?\\nChandler: You\\'re kidding.\\nJoey: Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You\\'d think you would\\'ve known that!\\nChandler: Y\\'know, you\\'d think I would\\'ve.\\nJoey: Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?\\nPhoebe: ...Flame Boy.\\nRoss: Where exactly is your zoo?\\nDr. Baldhara: Well, it\\'s technically not a zoo per se, it\\'s more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?\\nRoss: Yes.\\nDr. Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?\\nRoss: No-no, he\\'s, he\\'s very docile.\\nDr. Baldhara: Even if he were... cornered?\\nRoss: Well I, I don\\'t know. Why?\\nDr. Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?\\nRoss: He can hold a banana, if that\\'s whatcha mean...\\nDr. Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?\\nRoss: Why- why- why would he need a blade?\\nDr. Baldhara: Well, if he\\'s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you\\'ve got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it\\'s just cruel.\\nChandler and Joey: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.\\nJoey: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...\\nChandler: ...He\\'s in.\\nRoss: He\\'s in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!\\nDr. Baldhara: You\\'re making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego\\'s all well and good, but if you give him to me, I\\'ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.\\nMonica: Yo- hooo!\\nRachel: Where the hell\\'ve you been?\\nMonica: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.\\nRachel: Are you drunk?!\\nMonica: Noooo!  I\\'m lying. I am so drunk.\\nRachel: Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y\\'know what, you could\\'ve called, I have been up here, I\\'ve been worried...\\nRachel: Monica? Monica!\\nMonica: Water rules!\\nRachel: Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you\\'re gonna be showing up for work?\\nMonica: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.\\nRachel: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You\\'re gonna lose your job! This is not you!\\nMonica: No, it is me! Y\\'know, I\\'m not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y\\'know, when I\\'m with her, I am so much more than that. I\\'m- I\\'m Monana!\\nRachel: Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it\\'s for you, the credit card people.\\nMonica: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.\\nRachel: What?\\nMonica: They\\'ve arrested Monica.\\nMonica: Hi.\\nFake Monica: Hey.\\nMonica: How are you?\\nFake Monica: I\\'m not too bad. Fortunately, blue\\'s my colour. How-how did you know I was here?\\nMonica: Because... I\\'m Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.\\nFake Monica: That I was not expecting.\\nMonica: I want you to know, it wasn\\'t me who turned you in.\\nFake Monica: Oh. Thanks.\\nMonica: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn\\'t for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!\\nFake Monica: Well, actually, you only got to sing \\'Memo-\\'.\\nMonica: I just can\\'t believe you\\'re in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who\\'s gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who\\'s gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?\\nFake Monica: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you\\'re worried about who\\'s gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?\\nMonica: Well, not... worried, just... wondering.\\nFake Monica: There\\'s nothing to wonder about, Monica. You\\'re gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that\\'s who you are.\\nMonica: Not necessarily...\\nFake Monica: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it\\'s the Amish thing.\\nMonica: Um, I\\'m not actually Amish.\\nFake Monica: Really? Then why are you like that?\\nTeacher: You by the door. In or out?\\nMonica: In.\\nTeacher: You in the back, you\\'re getting it all wrong!\\nMonica: Yeah, but at least I\\'m doing it!\\nPA: This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.\\nPhoebe: Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don\\'t eat it \\'till you get on the plane.\\nRoss: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.\\nPhoebe: Oh!\\nChandler: Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there\\'s gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there\\'s also a lot to learn.\\nJoey: I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it\\'s a monkey.\\nRoss: Just, just say what you feel.\\nJoey: Marcel, I\\'m hungry.\\nRoss: That was good.\\nRachel:  Marcel, this is for you. It\\'s, uh, just, y\\'know, something to, um, do on the plane.\\nRoss: Uh, if you guys don\\'t mind, I\\'d like to take a moment, just me and him.\\nAll: Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.\\nRoss: Marcel, c\\'mere, c\\'mere.  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.\\nClosing Credits\\nActor:  Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...\\nCasting Director No. 1: That\\'s fine, thank you.\\nCasting Director No. 2: Next.\\nJoey: Hi, uh, I\\'ll be reading for the role of Mercutio.\\nCasting Director No. 2: Name?\\nJoey: Holden McGroin.\\nEnd\\n======== 01-22\\nWritten by: Alexa Junge Transcribed by: Mikael Hedberg\\nMonica: Tell him.\\nRachel: No.\\nPhoebe: Tell him, tell him.\\nMonica: Just...please tell him.\\nRachel: Shut up!\\nChandler: Tell me what?\\nMonica: Look at you, you won\\'t even look at him.\\nChandler:  Oh, come on tell me.

Monica, this is ridiculous, we\\'re great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.\\nMonica: It was.\\nYoung Ethan: Then, what\\'s the problem?\\nMonica: Ethan, it\\'s um... it\\'s icky.\\nYoung Ethan: Icky? You\\'re actually gonna throw this away because it\\'s icky?\\nMonica: This isn\\'t easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...\\nYoung Ethan: No, don\\'t say it.\\nMonica: ...love you.\\nRoss: Are you\\'re hands still wet?\\nJoey: Uh, moist, yeah.\\nRachel: Let\\'s dry \\'em again.\\nGerston: Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger?

When we\\'re 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?\\nMonica: Why won\\'t I be married when I\\'m 40?\\nChandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.\\nMonica: Ok, hypothetically, why won\\'t I be married when I\\'m 40?\\nChandler: No, no, no.\\nMonica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?\\nChandler:  Uh, uh.\\nMonica: Well?\\nChandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!\\nRachel: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Hey.

Was, like, your father a doctor?\\nRachel: Yeah, why?\\nChandler: No reason.\\nLydia: Mom, we\\'ve been through this. No, I\\'m not calling him. I don\\'t care if it is his kid, the guy\\'s a jerk. No, I\\'m not alone. Joey\\'s here.  Joey who?\\nJoey: Tribbiani.\\nLydia: Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on.  She wants to talk to you.

Just keep focusing on Jordie.\\nRoss: Who the hell is Jordie?\\nSusan: Your son.\\nRoss: No-no-no. I don\\'t have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son\\'s name is Jamie.\\nCarol: Well, Jamie was the name of Susan\\'s first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.\\nRoss: What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.\\nCarol: Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.\\nRoss: I got it.\\nSusan: I got it.\\nRoss: I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.\\nSusan: No, you don\\'t.\\nCarol: All right, that\\'s it. I want both of you out.\\nRoss: Why?\\nSusan: He started it!\\nRoss: No, you started it.\\nSusan: You did!\\nCarol: I don\\'t care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you\\'re not making it any easier.\\nRoss: But...\\nCarol: Now go!\\nRoss:  Thanks a lot.\\nSusan:  See what you did.\\nRoss:  Yeah, listen...\\nCarol: Out!\\nNurse: Breathe, breathe, breathe...\\nLydia: Oh, no.\\nJoey: Ew!

What\\'s that, water breaking?\\nNurse:  Breathe, breathe, breathe.\\nRoss: Please. This is so your fault.\\nSusan: How, how is this my fault?\\nRoss: Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.\\nSusan: Yeah? Well, there\\'s a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.\\nRoss: You tryin\\' to be clever? A funny lady?\\nSusan: You know what your problem is? You\\'re threatened by me.\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'m threatened by you?\\nSusan: Yes.\\nPhoebe: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that\\'s it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don\\'t believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!\\nRoss: Yeah, Susan.\\nPhoebe: Don\\'t make me do this again, I don\\'t like my voice like this.\\nPhoebe: Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?\\nCommercial Break\\nAll: Help!\\nRoss: I\\'m having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back.  Ow.\\nCarol: Are they here yet?\\nRachel: No, honey, they\\'re not, but don\\'t worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?\\nCarol: Ok.\\nRachel: Ok?\\nCarol: Ok.\\nRachel:  Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.\\nDr. Franzblau: It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel.  There you go, dear.\\nJoey: Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push \\'em out, push \\'em out, harder, harder.

So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?\\nRachel:  No, no, not at the moment, no, I\\'m not. Are you?\\nDr. Franzblau: No, it\\'s hard enough to get women to go out with me.\\nRachel: Right, yeah, I\\'ve heard that about cute doctors.\\nDr. Franzblau: No, no, really. I suppose it\\'s because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.\\nRachel: Oh.\\nDr. Franzblau: I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it\\'s hard, when you... do what I do. It\\'s like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?\\nRachel: I\\'m a waitress.\\nDr. Franzblau: Ok, all right, well aren\\'t there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you\\'re just like, \\'if I see one more cup of coffee\\'...\\nRachel:  Yeah. Gotcha.\\nDr. Franzblau: I\\'m gonna go check up on your friend.\\nRachel: Ok. That\\'s fine.\\nLydia: So how did you know I was even here?\\nGuy: Your mom called me. So is this her?\\nLydia: No, this is a loaner.\\nGuy: I\\'m sorry you had to do this by yourself.\\nLydia: I wasn\\'t by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?\\nGuy: Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.\\nLydia: Yeah, they\\'re not so bad.\\nRoss: Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y\\'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.\\nSusan: The woman I love is having a baby today. I\\'ve been waiting for this just as much as you have.\\nRoss: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?\\nSusan: You get to be the baby\\'s father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There\\'s Mother\\'s Day, there\\'s Father\\'s Day, there\\'s no... Lesbian Lover Day.\\nRoss: Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.\\nPhoebe: This is so great.\\nRoss: You wanna explain that?\\nPhoebe: I mean, well, \\'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here\\'s this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they\\'re fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it\\'s not even born yet. It\\'s just, it\\'s just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  I\\'m sorry, you were fighting.\\nCarol: Where are they?\\nMonica: I\\'m sure they\\'ll be here soon.\\nRachel: Yeah, honey, they wouldn\\'t miss this.\\nJoey: Relax. You\\'re only at nine centimeters. And the baby\\'s at zero station.\\nChandler:  You are really frightening me.\\nChandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin\\' to rip out my heart.  Anybody seen a nipple?\\nDr. Franzblau: All right, ten centimeters, here we go.\\nNurse: All right, honey, time to start pushing.\\nCarol: But they\\'re not here yet!\\nDr. Franzblau: I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t tell the baby to wait for them.\\nCarol: Oh, god.\\nRoss: Ok, got the vent open.\\nPhoebe:  Hi, I\\'m Ben. I\\'m hospital worker Ben. It\\'s Ben... to the rescue!\\nRoss: Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That\\'s it, Ben.\\nSusan: What do you see?\\nPhoebe: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.\\nRoss: Phoebs, It\\'s open! It\\'s open!\\nJanitor:  Wait! You forgot your legs!\\nAll: Push, push!\\nRoss: We\\'re here!\\nCarol:  Where have you been?\\nRoss: Long story, honey.\\nDr. Franzblau: All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?\\nNurse: All right, all right, there\\'s a few too many people in this room, and there\\'s about to be one more, so anybody who\\'s not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!\\nAll: Good luck!\\nChandler:  Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol\\'s lesbian life partner?\\nNurse: Out!\\nDr. Franzblau: All right, he\\'s crowning. Here he comes.\\nRoss: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it\\'s, it\\'s huge. Carol, how are you doing this?\\nCarol:  Not.... helping!\\nDr. Franzblau: You\\'re doing great, you\\'re doing fine.\\nRoss:  Oh, sorry.\\nSusan: What do you see?

Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don\\'t want us to have the bone, so I\\'m going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit\\'sit\\'s a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I\\'m gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can\\'t.

Do you guys know who Carl is?\\nChandler: Uh, let\\'s see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.\\nRoss: Well, Rachel\\'s having drinks with him tonight.\\nJoey: Oh no! How can she do that when she\\'s never shown any interest in you?!?\\nChandler: Forget about her.\\nJoey: He\\'s right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.\\nChandler: Course there, they just call it food.\\nRoss: Yeah... I guess. I don\\'tI don\\'t know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?\\nJoey: Listen, buddy, we\\'re just looking out for you.\\nRoss: I know.\\nJoey: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.\\nChandler: I\\'m still on my first. I just think you\\'re nice.\\nMelanie: Anyway, that\\'s when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves \\'The Three Basketeers.\\'\\nJoey: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.\\nChandler:\\nMonica:  OK, how does everybody like their burgers?\\nRachel: Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.\\nMonica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How\\'s it going? How you holding up?\\nJoey: Well, not so good.

Heh, heh.\\nMonica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?\\nJoey: What do you mean?\\nMonica: Y\\'know, just be there for her.\\nJoey: Not following you.\\nMonica: Think about it.\\nRachel: OK, I\\'m guessing this is from...\\nRachel: Well, thank you, Melanie.\\nChandler:  OK, this one right here is from me.\\nRachel:\\nRachel: This one\\'s from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it\\'s a book... feels like a book. And......it\\'s a book!\\nPhoebe: Oh, it\\'s Dr. Seuss!\\nJoey: : That book got me through some tough times.\\nMelanie: There is a little child inside this man!\\nChandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he\\'ll die.\\nRachel: Who\\'s this from?\\nChandler: Oh, that\\'s Ross\\'s.\\nRachel: Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.\\nPhoebe: Remembered what?\\nRachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can\\'t believe he remembered!\\nChandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?\\nPhoebe: Oh, it\\'s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe he did this.\\nChandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?\\nRachel: What did you just say?\\nChandler:  ahem... um... Crystal duck.\\nRachel: No, no, no.... the, um, the... \\'love\\' part?\\nChandler:  F-hah.... flennin....\\nRachel: Oh.... my God.\\nChandler:  Oh, no-no-no-no-no....\\nJoey:  That\\'s good, just keep rubbing your head. That\\'ll turn back time.\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: I mean, this is unbelievable.\\nPhoebe: I know. This is really, really huge.\\nChandler: No it\\'s not. It\\'s small. It\\'s tiny. It\\'s petite. It\\'s wee.\\nPhoebe: Nuh-uh. I don\\'t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.\\nChandler: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?\\nMonica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?\\nRachel: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?\\nJoey: Well, given that he\\'s desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn\\'t mind getting a cup of coffee or something.\\nRachel: Ross? All this time? Well, I\\'ve got to talk to him.\\nChandler:  H-He\\'s in China!\\nJoey: The country.\\nMonica: No, no, wait.  His flight doesn\\'t leave for another forty-five more minutes.\\nChandler: What about the time difference?\\nMonica: From here to the airport?\\nChandler: Yes!  You\\'re never gonna make it!\\nMonica: Rachel, what\\'re you gonna say to him?\\nRachel: I-I-I don\\'t know.\\nChandler: Well then maybe you shouldn\\'t go.\\nJoey: He\\'s right, cause if you\\'re just gonna, like, break his heart, that\\'s the kind of thing that can wait.\\nMonica: Yeah, but if it\\'s good news, you should tell him now.\\nRachel: I don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'ll know when I see him.\\nPhoebe: Here, look, alright, does this help?\\nRachel: Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y\\'know, I just, I\\'ve just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I\\'ll see you later.\\nChandler: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!\\nRoss:\\nFlight Attendant: Alright!\\nRoss: Ni-chou chi-ma!\\nRachel: Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....\\nFlight Attendant: Hi!\\nRachel: Hi.\\nFlight Attendant: May I see your boarding pass?\\nRachel: Oh, no, no, I don\\'t have one. I just need to talk to my friend.\\nFlight Attendant: Oh, oooh. I\\'m sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.\\nRachel: No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He\\'s right there, he\\'s got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...\\nFlight Attendant: No no no! Federal regulations!\\nRachel: OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.\\nFlight Attendant: Alright. What\\'s the message?\\nRachel: Uh... I don\\'t know.\\nFlight Attendant: Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.\\nMan:  What?\\nFlight Attendant: It\\'s from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.\\nMan: : Toby... Oh, for God\\'s sake, I don\\'t know what she\\'s talking about! There\\'s no Rachel! Don\\'t give me that deep freeze.\\nMelanie: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!\\nJoey: Heh, heh. It was nothin\\'.\\nMelanie: Well, now we\\'ve gotta find something fun for you!\\nJoey:  Uhhh.. y\\'know what? Forget about me. Let\\'s, uh... let\\'s give you another turn.\\nMelanie:  M-Me again?\\nJoey: Sure! Why not?\\nMelanie: Boy, somebody\\'s gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.\\nMelanie: Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.\\nJoey: How do you mean?\\nMelanie: I don\\'t know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who\\'re always \\'me, me, me.\\' But you... you\\'re a giver. You\\'re like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you\\'re practically a woman.\\nMonica: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it\\'s only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y\\'know, it\\'s Ross. Y\\'know what I mean? I mean, it\\'s Ross.\\nMonica and Phoebe: Sure.\\nRachel: I don\\'t know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I\\'m thinking... oh, I\\'m thinking it\\'d be really great.\\nMonica: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we\\'d be like friends-in-law! Y\\'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it\\'s like starting on the fifteenth date!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, but, y\\'know, it\\'s... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.\\nMonica: Another good point.\\nPhoebe: No, I mean, I mean, when you\\'re at the fifteenth date, y\\'know, you\\'re already in a very relationshippy place. Y\\'know, it\\'s... you\\'re committed.\\nRachel:  Huh?\\nPhoebe: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn\\'t work out?\\nMonica: Why isn\\'t it working out?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know... sometimes it doesn\\'t.\\nMonica: Is he not cute enough for you?\\nRachel: No!\\nMonica: Does he not make enough money?\\nRachel: No, I\\'m just....\\nPhoebe: Maybe there\\'s someone else.\\nRachel: Wha...\\nMonica: Is there? Is there someone else?\\nRachel: No! There is.. there is noone else!\\nMonica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?\\nChandler: Hey, big...\\nJoey: Shhhh!\\nChandler:  ...spender.\\nJoey: She\\'s still asleep.\\nChandler: So how\\'d it go?\\nJoey: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you\\'re great in bed?\\nChandler: The fact that you\\'d even ask that question shows how little you know me.\\nJoey: Well, it\\'s like, last night, I couldn\\'t do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!\\nChandler: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.\\nJoey: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It\\'s like, all of a sudden, I\\'m blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y\\'know? It\\'s like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.\\nChandler: I didn\\'t know you had another level.\\nJoey: I know! Neither did I!\\nMonica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nMonica: Oh, from who?\\nRachel: From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.\\nMonica: Well, it\\'s the thought. Hey, doesn\\'t Ross\\'s flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?\\nRachel: Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y\\'know, honey, I\\'ve been thinking about it and I\\'ve decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it\\'s just not a good idea.\\nMonica: Oh, why?\\nRachel: Because, I feel like I wouldn\\'t just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don\\'t wanna...\\nMonica:  No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!\\nRachel: Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you\\'re already so...\\nMonica: I am not \\'so\\'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I\\'ll be good. I promise.\\nRachel: Who is it?\\nIntercom: It\\'s me, Carl.\\nRachel: C\\'mon up.\\nMonica: Behind my brother\\'s back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won\\'t be hearing from me.\\nJoey: Seven hundred bucks!\\nChandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?\\nJoey: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y\\'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.\\nChandler: Really? So, you\\'re gonna stick with this \\'it\\'s all for her\\' thing?\\nJoey: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?\\nCarl: I\\'m just sayin\\', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I\\'m gonna shoot myself! I mean, don\\'t get me wrong... I\\'m not against environmental issues per se.... it\\'s just that guy!\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe you\\'d rather go out with him than me.\\nRachel: Would you excuse me, please? I\\'m trying to have a date here.\\nRoss: Fine, just stop thinking about me.\\nRoss: Can\\'t do it, can you?\\nRachel: So I\\'m thinking about you. So what?\\nRoss: I don\\'t get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?\\nRachel: Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....\\nCarl: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!\\nRoss: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.\\nRachel: Ross, it\\'s too hard.\\nRoss: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I\\'ve been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.\\nRachel: Ross, you\\'re like my best friend.\\nRoss: I know.\\nRachel: If we broke up, and I lost you...\\nRoss: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we\\'re gonna break up?\\nRachel: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven\\'t broken up?\\nRoss:  No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know... I mean, I\\'ve never looked at you that way before.\\nRoss: Well, start looking.\\nRachel: Wow.\\nCarl: Exactly! And you just know I\\'m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!\\nRachel: Right! You\\'re right!\\nCarl: Heh... y\\'know?\\nRachel: You know what?\\nCarl: What?\\nRachel: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I\\'m so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I meanI\\'m sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I\\'m sorry.\\nCarl: But...\\nRachel:  Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.\\nMan: For God\\'s sake, will you let it go? There\\'s no Rachel!\\nRoss: Oh, hey, hey, I got that.\\nJulie: Oh, thanks, sweetie.\\nRoss: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.\\nJulie: Really?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nJulie: You don\\'t think they\\'ll judge and ridicule me?\\nRoss: No, no, they will. I just... uh...\\nRoss and Julie: Can\\'t wait.\\nRoss: Come on, they\\'re gonna love you.\\nEnd\\n======== 02-01\\nPhoebe: Ok, so this is pretty much what\\'s happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn\\'t know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that\\'s pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how\\'ve you been?\\nOpening Credits\\nRachel: Oh my god. Oh my god.\\nRoss:  Rach!\\nRachel: Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?\\nRoss: It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss: You\\'re bleeding.\\nRachel: I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.\\nRoss: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.\\nRachel: These are, these aren\\'t for you.  Welcome to our country.\\nJulie:  Thank you. I\\'m from New York.\\nRachel: Ok, well, not a problem. We\\'ll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.\\nChandler: No way!\\nMonica: I\\'m telling you, she went to the airport, and she\\'s gonna go for it with Ross!\\nPhoebe: Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what\\'s bigger than huge?\\nJoey: Um, this?\\nPhoebe: Yes.\\nMonica: Guys, you got your hair cut.\\nChandler: Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.\\nPhoebe: \\'Cause, you know,  if you don\\'t look good, we don\\'t look good. I love that voice.\\nRachel:  Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.\\nChandler: Ok, I think she\\'s trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.\\nRachel:  You, you slowpokes!\\nRoss: That\\'s all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?\\nJoey: What up?!\\nRoss: Everyone, this is Julie.\\nRachel:  Julie.\\nAll: Ohh.  Hi!\\nJulie: Hi, but I\\'m not here, you haven\\'t met me. I\\'ll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don\\'t have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.\\nRoss: And bus.\\nJulie: Oh my god.\\nRoss: The screaming guy?\\nJulie: And the spitting?\\nRoss: You gotta hear this story.\\nJulie: We\\'re on this bus, that\\'s easily 200 years old...\\nRoss: 200 at least.\\nJulie: ...and this guy...\\nRachel: And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I\\'m so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn\\'t I? Oh! It\\'s just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.\\nMonica: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?\\nJulie: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.\\nRoss: But we haven\\'t seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who\\'s in charge of the dig.\\nRachel: Julie! Julie, isn\\'t that great? I mean, isn\\'t that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?\\nMonica:  It\\'s an expression.\\nRoss: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we\\'re gonna go see the baby.\\nJulie: And then we\\'ve gotta get some sleep.\\nRoss: Yeah, it\\'s really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.\\nChandler: Well, listen, don\\'t tell us what\\'s gonna happen though, \\'cause I like to be surprised.\\nRachel: Bye.\\nRoss: Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?\\nRachel: Yeah, sure.\\nRoss: Thank you.\\nChandler: Hey, Rach, can I get...\\nRachel: Did you talk to him?\\nChandler: Not yet.\\nRachel: Then, no.\\nChandler: So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.\\nRoss: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it\\'s never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?\\nChandler: God?\\nRoss: It was you, pal.\\nChandler: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.\\nRoss: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that\\'s all. But then I met Julie, and I don\\'t know, we\\'re havin\\' a great time. And I have to say, I never would\\'ve gone for it with her if it hadn\\'t been for you.\\nChandler: Well, you owe me one, big guy.\\nRachel:  Here\\'s your lemonade.\\nRoss: I didn\\'t order lemonade.\\nRachel: Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they\\'re gonna charge you for that.\\nRoss: But...\\nRachel: Go-go-go-go, come on!  So uh, what did you find out?\\nChandler: He said...he said, he said that they\\'re having a great time. I\\'m sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.\\nRachel: How is that the silver lining?\\nChandler: You have to really wanna see it.\\nRoss: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.\\nMonica: Pheebes, you know what I\\'m thinking?\\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. How, it\\'s been so long since you\\'ve had sex, you\\'re wondering if they\\'ve changed it?\\nMonica: No, although now that\\'s what I\\'m thinking.\\nPhoebe: All right, so what were you thinking?\\nMonica: Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you\\'d like to do mine?\\nPhoebe: Ohh! No.\\nMonica: Why not?\\nPhoebe: Because, I\\'m just, I\\'m incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.\\nMonica: No you\\'re not.\\nPhoebe: I know I\\'m not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.\\nJoey:\\nRoss:  Hello? Hi.\\nChandler:  Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?\\nJoey: Needs some clothes altered?\\nChandler: No, no, I\\'m just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.\\nJoey: Why don\\'t you go see Frankie? My family\\'s been goin\\' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, \\'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990?\\nChandler: Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there\\'s resistance!\\nRoss:  Well you didn\\'t hang up either.\\nRachel: She didn\\'t hang up either!\\nRoss: Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...\\nRachel:  Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.\\nRoss: Rachel! I\\'ll just call her back.\\nRachel: Okay!\\nRoss:\\nRachel:  Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he\\'s Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can\\'t have.\\nMonica: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.\\nRachel: I know you did. I\\'m just gonna deal with it, I\\'m just gonna deal with it.\\nChandler: Ok, I don\\'t care what you guys say, something\\'s bothering her.\\nJoey:  You know, I think I was sixteen.\\nMonica:  Please, just a little bit off the back.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m still on \"no.\"\\nRachel:  Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?\\nJoey: No-no-no-no-no,  I\\'m not fallin\\' for that again.\\nPhoebe: What\\'s goin\\' on?\\nRachel: Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.\\nChandler: What stupid thing did you do?\\nPaulo:  Bon giorno tutti!\\nPhoebe: Ewww!\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: Ok, Paulo, why don\\'t you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.\\nMonica: Rachel, how did this happen?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know, I just kinda ran into him last night.\\nPhoebe: Where?\\nRachel: At his apartment. Is this juice?\\nJoey: Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?\\nRachel: Oh God, I know I\\'m a pathetic loser.\\nMonica: Honey, you\\'re not pathetic, you\\'re sad.\\nChandler: People do stupid things when they\\'re upset.\\nMonica: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn\\'t..., but this is about your horrible mistake.\\nAll: Hi!\\nRoss: Hi. Sorry we\\'re late but we werewell, there was touching.\\nPaulo:  Hey, hey Ross.\\nRoss: Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?\\nPaulo: I do Raquel.\\nRoss:  So, uh, he\\'s back.\\nRachel: Yeah, he\\'s back. Is that a problem?\\nRoss: No, not a problem.\\nRachel: Good! I\\'m glad it\\'s not a problem.\\nPhoebe:  Ok, you\\'re gonna have to not touch my ass.\\nChandler: Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I\\'ve got pants that need to be altered.\\nJoey: Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He\\'ll know what it means.\\nChandler: Are you sure he\\'s gonna be able to crack that code?\\nMonica:  You know it\\'s funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.\\nPhoebe: All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.\\nMonica: I promise.\\nPhoebe: All right.  Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren\\'t. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.\\nPhoebe: All right, that\\'s it, I quit.\\nMonica: What? I didn\\'t say anything.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, but this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn\\'t trust a person.\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry, Phoebe. It\\'s just a little shorter than what we had discussed.\\nPhoebe: Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.\\nMonica: How who wears it?\\nPhoebe: Demi Moore.\\nMonica: Demi Moore is not a he.\\nPhoebe: Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.\\nMonica: That\\'s Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.\\nPhoebe: Oh. Oh!\\nMonica: Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\\nMonica: Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Oh my God! I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. Which one\\'s Demi Moore?\\nMonica: She\\'s the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!\\nPhoebe: Oh, she\\'s got gorgeous hair.\\nMonica: I know!\\nFrankie: How long do you want the cuffs?\\nChandler: At least as long as I have the pants.\\nFrankie: I just got that. Ok, now we\\'ll do your inseam.\\nRachel: How is she?\\nPhoebe: It\\'s too soon to tell. She\\'s resting, which is a good sign.\\nRoss: How\\'s the hair?\\nPhoebe: I\\'m not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn\\'t look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.\\nJoey: Can we see her?\\nPhoebe: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don\\'t you come on in.\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nJoey: How\\'re you doing?\\nRachel: I\\'m okay.\\nJoey: Ooh, that bad, huh?\\nRachel: What?\\nJoey: Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It\\'s one of my gifts.\\nRachel: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it\\'s like there\\'s rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.\\nJoey: You gotta tell Ross how you feel.\\nRachel: Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?\\nJoey: What about her? They\\'ve only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.\\nRachel: I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know.\\nJoey: Look, Rach, Rach! I\\'ve been with my share of women. In fact, I\\'ve been with like a lot of people\\'s share of women. The point is, I\\'ve never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.\\nChandler:  Your tailor is a very bad man!\\nJoey: Frankie? What\\'re you talking about?\\nRoss:\\nChandler: Joey\\'s tailor...took advantage of me.\\nRoss: What?\\nJoey: No way. I\\'ve been going to the guy for 12 years.\\nChandler: Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...\\nRoss: What?\\nChandler: Cupping.\\nJoey: That\\'s how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn\\'t that how they measure pants?\\nRoss: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?\\nJoey: What? That\\'s not?  Oh my God.\\nMonica: Even Mary Tyler Moore would\\'ve been better.\\nRoss: I like it. I do, I think it\\'s a Ten.\\nMonica: Thank you. My hair is very amused.\\nChandler: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it\\'s crazy, but it\\'s true.\\nPhoebe:  Thank you.\\nRoss: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.\\nRachel:  Wait, are you leaving?\\nRoss: Yeah, that\\'s kinda what I meant by \"bye!\"\\nRachel: Well, can I talk to you for a sec?\\nRoss: Okay.\\nJoey: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...\\nChandler: That\\'s ok.\\nRoss: What\\'s goin\\' on?\\nRachel: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn\\'t. Um, second of all , what?\\nRoss: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?\\nRachel: No. No-no-no-no.\\nRoss: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.\\nRachel: Really?\\nRoss: You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking \"Oh my god, I\\'m with Rachel\". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?\\nRachel: No, I think that was the whole all.\\nRoss: Okay. Okay.  Okay.\\nJoey: I swear to god, Dad. That\\'s not how they measure pants.\\nClosing Credits\\nJulie: I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell\\'s new haircut?\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.\\nJulie: Really?\\nPhoebe: You wanna do it right now?\\nJulie: Great!\\nPhoebe:  Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell\\'s the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?\\nRachel: No. No no no no no. That\\'s Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.\\nRachel: You\\'re welcome.\\nEnd\\n======== 02-02\\nWritten by: Adam Chase & Ira Ungerleider Transcribed by: Mindy Mattingly Phillips With Minor Adjustments by: Eric Aasen\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe: Oh, look at these!

Oh, Hi, Ju\\nRachel: Did you just say Hi, Jew?\\nMonica: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.\\nPhoebe: Ben, dinner!\\nRoss: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn\\'t microwave that, did you, because it\\'s breast milk, and you\\'re not supposed to do that.\\nPhoebe: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.\\nChandler: What did you just do?\\nPhoebe: I licked my arm, what?\\nRoss: It\\'s breast milk.\\nPhoebe: So?\\nRachel: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.\\nJoey: What is the big deal?\\nChandler: What did you just do?\\nRoss: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?\\nPhoebe: You won\\'t even taste it?\\nRoss: No!\\nPhoebe: Not even if you just pretend that it\\'s milk?\\nRoss: Not even if Carol\\'s breast had a picture of a missing child on it.\\nMonica: Hey, where is everybody?\\nRachel: They took Ben to the park. Where\\'ve you been?\\nMonica: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.\\nRachel: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way.\\nMonica: Okay.\\nRachel: Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?\\nMonica: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.\\nRachel: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?\\nMonica: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.\\nRachel: Monica, what is with you? Who\\'d you have lunch with?\\nMonica: Judy.\\nRachel: Who?\\nMonica: Julie.\\nRachel: What?!\\nMonica: Jody!\\nRachel: You were with Julie?\\nMonica: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother\\'s girlfriend.

It didn\\'t mean anything to me.\\nRachel: Yeah, right. Sure!\\nMonica: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I\\'m sorry, all right.

It\\'s gross.\\nCarol: My breast milk is gross?\\nSusan: This should be fun.\\nRoss: No, no, Carol. There\\'s nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don\\'t think breast milk is for adults.\\nChandler: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.\\nCarol: Ross, you\\'re being silly. I\\'ve tried it, it\\'s no big deal. Just taste it.\\nRoss:  That would be no.\\nPhoebe: Come on. It doesn\\'t taste bad.\\nJoey: Yeah, it\\'s kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...\\nSusan: Cantaloupe juice.\\nJoey: Exactly.\\nRoss:  You\\'ve tasted it? You\\'ve tasted it.\\nSusan: Uh huh.\\nRoss: Oh, you\\'ve tasted it.\\nSusan: You can keep saying it, but it won\\'t stop being true.\\nRoss:\\nChandler: Howdy.\\nJoey:  Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.\\nChandler: Well, maybe it\\'s because of the way you\\'re dressed.\\nJoey: Or maybe it\\'s because this guy\\'s doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.\\nChandler:  What do you care? You\\'re an actor. This is your day job. This isn\\'t supposed to mean anything to you.\\nJoey: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don\\'t know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.\\nChandler:  All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody\\'s gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where\\'re you gonna run?\\nJoey: Yeah I guess you\\'re right.\\nChandler: You\\'re damn right I\\'m right. I say you show this guy what you\\'re made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.\\nJoey: I\\'m gonna do it.\\nChandler: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she\\'ll fix you up with a nice hooker.\\nMonica: I don\\'t know what else to say.\\nRachel: Well that works out good, because I\\'m not listening.\\nMonica: I feel terrible, I really do.\\nRachel: Oh, I\\'m sorry, did my back hurt your knife?\\nMonica: Rachel,  say that I\\'m friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?\\nRachel: Yes.\\nMonica: It\\'s that terrible?\\nRachel: Yes. Monica, you don\\'t get it. It\\'s bad enough that she\\'s stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she\\'s actually , but now she\\'s actually stealing you.\\nMonica: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I\\'m friends with her doesn\\'t make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you\\'re my...We\\'re, we\\'re...Oh, I love you.\\nRachel: I love you too.\\nPhoebe: You guys, um I know that this really doesn\\'t have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too.\\nMonica: Look, I know that you\\'re in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie\\'s guts, but she didn\\'t do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you\\'d like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?\\nRachel:  I\\'d do anything for you, you know that.\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe: Wait, wait, wait, wait!\\nJoey: Mornin\\'.  I said, mornin\\'.\\nHombre Man: I heard ya.\\nStore Guy: All right, everybody, I\\'m openin\\' the doors. You boys ready?\\nHombre Man: Ready.\\nJoey: Yeah, I\\'m ready.\\nCustomer: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I\\'m suing!\\nStore Guy: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?\\nHombre Man: I\\'m sorry. I am such a doofus. I\\'m so sorry, I\\'m so sorry.\\nAnnabelle:  My god, what happened?\\nJoey: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin\\'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?\\nAnnabelle: Sure.\\nJulie: So.\\nRachel: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we\\'ve never really talked. I guess you\\'d know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?\\nJulie: I know, I probably shouldn\\'t even tell you this, but I\\'m pretty much totally intimidated by you.\\nRachel: Really? Me?\\nJulie: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it\\'s probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don\\'t.\\nRachel: Well, you\\'re not totally paranoid.\\nJulie: Oy.\\nRachel: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I\\'m not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica\\'s always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she\\'s right.\\nJulie: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?\\nRachel: Yeah, that\\'d be great. I\\'d love it.\\nJulie: I\\'d love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I\\'ll talk to you later.\\nRachel: All right, Julie.\\nJulie: Bye.\\nRachel: Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.\\nClosing Credits\\nRoss:  That\\'s not bad.\\nEnd\\n======== 02-03\\nOriginally written by Michael Curtis and Greg Malins Trascribed by Mindy Mattingly Phillips  With Minor Adjustments by: Eric Aasen\\nCHANDLER: Hey.\\nMONICA: So how was Joan?\\nCHANDLER: I broke up with her.\\nCHANDLER: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.\\nRACHEL: Come on, they were not that huge.\\nCHANDLER: I\\'m tellin\\' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.\\nMONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?\\nJOEY: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam\\'s apple. It made me nuts.\\nCHANDLER: You or me?\\nROSS: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don\\'t have Adam\\'s apples.\\nJOEY: You guys are messin\\' with me, right?\\nALL: Yeah.\\nJOEY: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, \"whoa.\"\\nPHOEBE: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.\\nCHANDLER: Maureen Rosilla.\\nROSS: Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.\\nMONICA: Hello, Mr. Heckles.\\nMR. HECKLES: You\\'re doing it again.\\nMONICA: We\\'re not doing anything.\\nMR. HECKLES: You\\'re stomping. It\\'s disturbing my birds.\\nRACHEL: You don\\'t have birds.\\nMR. HECKLES: I could have birds.\\nMONICA: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we\\'ll try to keep it down.\\nMR. HECKLES: Thank you. I\\'m going to rejoin my dinner party.\\nRACHEL: All right, bye-bye.\\nCHANDLER: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn\\'t about being picky.\\nROSS: We\\'ll give you Janice.\\nPHOEBE: I miss Janice though. \"Hello, Chandler Bing.\"\\nRACHEL: \"Oh, my, god.\"\\nJOEY: \"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that\\'s it. There, faster!\"\\nMONICA: Stop with the broom, we\\'re not making noise.\\nRACHEL: We won. We won!\\nMONICA: Mr. Heckles.\\nRACHEL: How did this happen?\\nMR. TREEGER: He musta been sweepin\\'. They found a broom in his hand.\\nMONICA: That\\'s terrible.\\nMR. TREEGER: I know. I was sweepin\\' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin\\'. You never know.\\nMR. TREEGER: You never know.\\nPHOEBE: Ok, it\\'s very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!\\nCHANDLER: Ok, Phoebe.\\nPHOEBE: I\\'m sorry, but sometimes they need help. That\\'s fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there\\'re a lot of things that I don\\'t believe in, but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re not true.\\nJOEY: Such as?\\nPHOEBE: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?\\nROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don\\'t, uh, you don\\'t believe in evolution?\\nPHOEBE: Nah. Not really.\\nROSS: You don\\'t believe in evolution?\\nPHOEBE: I don\\'t know, it\\'s just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it\\'s a, it\\'s a nice story, I just think it\\'s a little too easy.\\nROSS: Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?\\nPHOEBE: Yeah, I just don\\'t buy it.\\nROSS: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.\\nPHOEBE: Ok, don\\'t get me started on gravity.\\nROSS: You uh, you don\\'t believe in gravity?\\nPHOEBE: Well, it\\'s not so much that you know, like I don\\'t believe in it, you know, it\\'s just...I don\\'t know, lately I get the feeling that I\\'m not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.\\nCHANDLER: Uh-Oh. It\\'s Isaac Newton, and he\\'s pissed.\\nMR. TREEGER: There she is. And over there, that\\'s the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles\\' attorney. He\\'d like to talk to you.\\nMONICA: What can we do for you?\\nMR. BOYLE: All right, kids. Here\\'s the deal. According to my client\\'s will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to \"the noisy girls in the apartment above mine\".\\nMONICA: Well, what about his family?\\nMR. BOYLE: He didn\\'t have any.\\nRACHEL: Ok, so let\\'s talk money.\\nMR. BOYLE: All right, there was none. Let\\'s talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.\\nMONICA: I can\\'t believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn\\'t it amazing how much you can touch someone\\'s life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!\\nRACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?\\nCHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap\\nJOEY: Check this out. Can I have this?\\nROSS: How can you not believe in evolution?\\nPHOEBE: Just don\\'t. Look at this funky shirt!\\nROSS: Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.\\nPHOEBE: Really? You can actually see it?\\nROSS: You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.\\nPHOEBE: See, I didn\\'t know that.\\nROSS: Well, there you go.\\nPHOEBE: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?\\nCHANDLER: Hey, look at this. \"My Big Book of Grievances.\"\\nJOEY: Hey, there\\'s me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you\\'re in here too.\\nCHANDLER: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy\\'s gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that\\'s excellent.\\nRACHEL: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.\\nMONICA: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.\\nRACHEL: What? Come on, it\\'s not like I\\'m asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.\\nMONICA: It doesn\\'t go with any of my stuff.\\nRACHEL: Well, what about my stuff?\\nMONICA: You don\\'t have any stuff.\\nRACHEL: You still think of it as your apartment, don\\'t you?\\nMONICA: No.\\nRACHEL: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I\\'m just somebody who rents a room.\\nMONICA: Mmmmm.\\nRACHEL: Ok, while you \"mmm\" on it for awhile, I\\'m gonna go find a place for my new lamp.\\nROSS: Ok, Pheebs. See how I\\'m making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?\\nPHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.\\nROSS: Please tell me you\\'re joking.\\nPHOEBE: Look, can\\'t we just say that you believe in something, and I don\\'t.\\nROSS: No, no, Pheebs, we can\\'t, ok, because--\\nPHOEBE: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what\\'s that all about? I think, I think maybe it\\'s time you put Ross under the microscope.\\nROSS: Is there blood coming out of my ears?\\nJOEY: Check it out, check it out. Heckles\\' high school yearbook.\\nCHANDLER: Wow, he looks so normal.\\nPHOEBE: He\\'s even kind of cute.\\nJOEY: \"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You\\'re the funniest kid in school.\\nCHANDLER: Funniest? Heckles?\\nJOEY: That\\'s what it says.\\nCHANDLER: Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?\\nPHOEBE: I\\'d call that excessive.\\nCHANDLER: Whoa!\\nJOEY: What?\\nCHANDLER: Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler\\'s club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.\\nJOEY: So, you were both dorks. Big deal.\\nCHANDLER: I just think it\\'s weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?\\nJOEY: Have you been here all night?\\nCHANDLER: Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I\\'m gonna end up alone, just like he did.\\nJOEY: Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.\\nCHANDLER: Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I\\'m coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.\\nJOEY: All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I\\'ll buy you breakfast, let\\'s go.\\nCHANDLER: What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I\\'ve found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \"supposably\"?\\nJOEY: Chandler, come on, you\\'re gonna find somebody.\\nCHANDLER: How do you know that? How?\\nJOEY: I don\\'t know, I\\'m just tryin\\' to help you out.\\nCHANDLER: You\\'ll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I\\'m gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you\\'re married, will you invite me over for holidays?\\nJOEY: Well, I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know what we\\'re gonna be doin\\'. I mean, what if we\\'re at her folks\\' place?\\nCHANDLER: Yeah, I understand.\\nJOEY: You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?\\nCHANDLER: You know what? I\\'m not gonna end up like this. I\\'ll see you man.\\nJOEY: Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.\\nCHANDLER:  Hi, it\\'s me.\\nJANICE: Oh, my, god.\\nPHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?\\nCHANDLER: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?\\nROSS: You remember Janice, right?\\nCHANDLER: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.\\nJANICE: Helloo!!\\nCHANDLER: Oh, my, god!\\nJOEY: Geez, look how fat she got.\\nJANICE: Hey, it\\'s everybody.\\nCHANDLER: Janice, you\\'re--\\nJANICE: Yes, I am.\\nCHANDLER: Is it--?\\nJANICE: Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.\\nCHANDLER: Congratulations.\\nJANICE: Oh, sweetie, I\\'m sorry.\\nCHANDLER: You couldn\\'t have told me about this on the phone?\\nJANICE: And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.\\nMONICA: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven\\'t played in a while?\\nRACHEL: What?\\nMONICA: Hide the Lamp.\\nRACHEL: Monica, let it go.\\nMONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?\\nRACHEL: Well, then, you\\'ll just have to eat the other lamps.\\nPHOEBE: Uh-oh. It\\'s Scary Scientist Man.\\nROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.\\nPHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I\\'m not denying evolution, ok, I\\'m just saying that it\\'s one of the possibilities.\\nROSS: It\\'s the only possibility, Phoebe.\\nPHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn\\'t there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can\\'t admit that there\\'s a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?\\nROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.\\nPHOEBE: I can\\'t believe you caved.\\nROSS: What?\\nPHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn\\'t agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who\\'s hungry?\\nRACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.\\nMONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.\\nRACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You\\'ve always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it\\'s just magically broken?\\nMONICA: Phoebe, tell her!\\nPHOEBE: Ok, I didn\\'t see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.\\nRACHEL: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.\\nCHANDLER: Neat. I\\'m gonna die alone.\\nRACHEL: Ok, you win.\\nMONICA: Chandler, you\\'re not gonna die alone.\\nCHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.\\nPHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?\\nCHANDLER: If I\\'m gonna be an old, lonely man, I\\'m gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I\\'ll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I\\'ll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they\\'ll shout!\\nMONICA: You have got to get over this. You\\'re not gonna end up alone.\\nCHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who\\'s crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren\\'t any great women out there.\\nRACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.\\nMONICA: You are not a freak. You\\'re a guy.\\nRACHEL: She\\'s right. She\\'s right. You are no different than the rest of them.\\nMONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.\\nCHANDLER: In a bad way?\\nMONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don\\'t even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.\\nRACHEL: Yeah. You\\'re not gonna end up alone.\\nPHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That\\'s how much you wanted to be with someone!\\nMONICA: You made it!\\nPHOEBE: You\\'re there!\\nRACHEL: You are ready to make a commitment!\\nCHANDLER: Whoa! Don\\'t know about that.\\nRACHEL: What you got there? Something else that\\'s not yours that you can break?\\nMONICA: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it\\'ll look good in our apartment.\\nRACHEL: Thank you.\\nMONICA: That\\'s fine.\\nCHANDLER: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She\\'s great. She\\'s pretty, she\\'s smart. And uh, I\\'ve been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I\\'m not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I\\'m growing.\\nJOEY: Hey, uh, you can\\'t recycle yearbooks, can you?\\nCHANDLER: I\\'ll take that.\\nJOEY: You want his yearbook?\\nCHANDLER: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.\\nMONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it\\'s gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You\\'re all going to hell.\\nRACHEL: It\\'s really not that big!\\nCHANDLER: Takin\\' that with you, huh?\\nJOEY: Oh, yeah.\\nROSS: You comin\\'?\\nCHANDLER: Yeah, jus\\' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We\\'ll try to keep it down.\\nALISON: Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see \"Philosopher wanted\"?\\nCHANDLER: Sure.\\nEND\\n======== 02-04\\nOriginally written by Alexa Junge Transcribed by Josh Hodge.\\n  ROSS: Good morning.

My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.\\n: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.\\nJADE: Hello, I\\'m looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don\\'t know if you\\'re still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it\\'s been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?\\nCHANDLER: What?\\nJADE: I got a little drunk...and naked.\\nCHANDLER: Bob here.\\nCHANDLER:  What\\'ve you been up to?\\nJADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.\\nCHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.\\nROSS: I know.\\nCHANDLER: I\\'m back.\\nJADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?\\nCHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how \\'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?\\nJADE: Great, I\\'ll see you then.\\nCHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.\\nROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I\\'m thinkin\\' when she sees you tomorow, she\\'s probably gonna realize, \"hey, you\\'re not Bob.\"\\nCHANDLER: I\\'m hoping that when Bob doesn\\'t show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.\\nROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.\\nCHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I\\'ve done this.\\nROSS:  Yeah, yeah, everybody\\'s here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.\\nALL: Hi, Julie!\\nRACHEL:  Hi, Julie.\\nCHANDLER: Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.\\nPHOEBE: Um, is, is there any chance that you\\'re rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?\\nCHANDLER: Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.\\nJOEY: Do we need a cake?\\nCHANDLER: Look guys, I know it\\'s a little steep.\\nRACHEL: Yeah, whoosh!\\nCHANDLER: But it\\'s Ross.\\nPHOEBE: It\\'s Ross.\\nJOEY: All right.\\nCHANDLER: I\\'ll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.\\nROSS: Ok, sweetheart, I\\'ll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you\\'re not really gonna go through with this, are you?\\nCHANDLER: You know, I think I might just.\\nRACHEL: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?\\nJOEY: Well I guess I gotta start savin\\' up for Ross\\'s birthday, so I guess I\\'ll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.\\nPHOEBE: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?\\nRACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don\\'t get that we don\\'t make as much money as they do?\\nJOEY: Yes! Yeah, it\\'s like they\\'re always saying \"let\\'s go here, let\\'s go there\". Like we can afford to go here and there.\\nPHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it\\'s, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it\\'s not like we can say anything about it, \\'cause, like this birthday thing, it\\'s for Ross.\\nJOEY: For Ross.\\nRACHEL: For Ross, Ross, Ross.\\nMONICA:  Oh my god.\\nRACHEL: Hey.\\nJOEY: Hi.\\nRACHEL: What?\\nMONICA: I\\'m at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.\\nJOEY: If it\\'s not you, this is a horrible story.\\nMONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.\\nJOEY: Yeah, someplace nice.\\nROSS: I\\'m tellin\\' you. You can\\'t do this.\\nCHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.\\nROSS: That doesn\\'t matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people\\'s chance for happiness.\\nCHANDLER: We don\\'t know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.\\nROSS: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.\\nCHANDLER: All right.\\nROSS: Go.\\nCHANDLER: Hi.\\nJADE: Hi.\\nCHANDLER: Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.\\nJADE: Yes?\\nCHANDLER: Whoever stood you up is a jerk.\\nJADE: How did you--?\\nCHANDLER: I don\\'t know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that\\'s me. I\\'m weird and sensitive. Tissue?\\nJADE: Thanks.\\nCHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I\\'m all cried out today.\\nROSS: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--\\nMONICA: Who is also in charge of purchasing.\\nROSS: Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--\\nMONICA: Who has her own little desk when Roland\\'s not there.\\nROSS: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland\\'s not there. Here\\'s to my little sister--\\nMONICA: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!\\nJOEY: Cool.\\nPHOEBE: Let\\'s see!\\nROSS: That\\'s fine, I\\'ll just wait!\\nMONICA: Oh, sorry.\\nJOEY: Sorry, sorry.\\nROSS: Monica!\\nWAITER: Are we ready to order?\\nRACHEL: Oh, you know what, we haven\\'t even looked yet.\\nWAITER: Well, when you do, just let me know. I\\'ll be right over there on the edge of my seat.\\nPHOEBE: Wow, look at these prices.\\nRACHEL: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.\\nJOEY: What are these, like famous chickens?\\nCHANDLER: Hey, sorry I\\'m late. Congratulations, Mon.  I\\'m not sorry I\\'m late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?\\nROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?\\nCHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn\\'t tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob\\'s number.\\nROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?\\nWAITER: Do I dare ask?\\nMONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I\\'ll have the grilled prawns.\\nROSS: That sounds great. Same for me.\\nWAITER: And for the gentleman?\\nJOEY: Yeah, I\\'ll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?\\nWAITER: You\\'d think, wouldn\\'t you?

It\\'s no big deal.\\nPHOEBE: Not for you.\\nMONICA: All right, what\\'s goin\\' on?\\nRACHEL: Ok, look you guys, I really don\\'t want to get into this right now.

Whoa, hey, I don\\'t want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there\\'s gonna be a hoopla?\\nRACHEL: Basically, there\\'s the thing, and then there\\'s the stuff after the thing.\\nMONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we\\'ll just do the gift.\\nROSS: G-gift? The thing\\'s not the gift?\\nCHANDLER: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.\\nROSS: Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.\\nPHOEBE: No, now I feel bad.

Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?\\nCHANDLER: By the way, this didn\\'t seem so dorky in the hall.\\nROSS: Come on.\\nCHANDLER: Why, it\\'s six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!\\nMONICA: It\\'s on us, all right, so don\\'t worry. It\\'s our treat.\\nPHOEBE: So...Thank you.\\nROSS: Could you be less enthused?\\nJOEY: Look, it\\'s a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--\\nMONICA: Like?\\nJOEY: Charity.\\nMONICA: Charity?\\nROSS: We\\'re just tryin\\' to do a nice thing here.\\nRACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.\\nPHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.\\nROSS: I don\\'t, I don\\'t understand. I mean, you, it\\'s like we can\\'t win with you guys.\\nCHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that\\'s not our fault. Maybe that\\'s just how you feel.\\nJOEY: Oh, now you\\'re tellin\\' us how you feel.\\nRACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.\\nPHOEBE: I\\'m just gonna pass on the concert, \\'cause I\\'m just not in a very Hootie place right now.\\nRACHEL: Me neither.\\nJOEY: Me too.\\nMONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.\\nPHOEBE: Oh, well, then you\\'ll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.\\nCHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?\\nMONICA: Well, I guess now we can\\'t go.\\nRACHEL: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?\\nMONICA: You know what? You\\'re right.\\nPHOEBE: Fine.\\nROSS: Fine.\\nJOEY: Fine.\\nCHANDLER: Fine.\\nRACHEL: Fine.\\nMONICA: All right. We\\'re gonna go. It\\'s not for another six hours. We\\'re gonna go then.\\nROSS: Chandler!\\nCHANDLER: Yeah?\\nROSS: Geez! Are you ready?\\nCHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.\\nROSS: Whoa! You had sex today?\\nCHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.\\nROSS: Wow.\\nCHANDLER: Now I know it\\'s been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.\\nROSS: Still doing the screening thing?\\nCHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.\\nMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.\\nJADE: Hey, Bob, it\\'s Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn\\'t show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.\\nCHANDLER: Bob here.\\nJADE: Oh, hi.\\nCHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh?\\nJADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.\\nCHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?\\nJADE: Eh.\\nCHANDLER: Eh?\\nJADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.\\nCHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.\\nJADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.\\nROSS:  Bumpy?\\nCHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you\\'re not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.\\nJADE: Well there really wasn\\'t much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?\\nMONICA: You know what? I\\'m not gonna be able to enjoy this.\\nROSS: Yeah, I know, it\\'s my birthday. We all should be here.\\nCHANDLER: So, let\\'s go.\\nROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.\\nCHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.\\nMONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.\\nJOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.\\nPHOEBE: Ok. One.\\nJOEY: Nooo.\\nMONICA: That was amazing!\\nROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.\\nCHANDLER: I can\\'t believe the guys missed this.\\nROSS: What guys?

I gotta run backstage.\\nMONICA: Uh, wait, backstage?\\nSTEVE: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.\\nROSS: Ross.\\nCHANDLER: Chandler.\\nSTEVE: How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?\\nROSS: Hey, you guys.\\nRACHEL: Happy birthday.\\nROSS: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?\\nRACHEL: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?\\nMONICA: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?\\nRACHEL: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how\\'s his dad?\\nMONICA: Uh, good.\\nROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.\\nCHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.\\nJOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.\\nPHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?\\nMONICA: No, I just, I fell down.\\nRACHEL: On someone\\'s lips? Where\\'d you get the hickey?\\nMONICA: You know, a party, or--\\nRACHEL: What party?\\nROSS: It wasn\\'t so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.\\nJOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?\\nCHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.\\nRACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?\\nMONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.\\nRACHEL: Oh!\\nPHOEBE: Oh! I can\\'t believe it. I can\\'t believe this. We\\'re just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey\\'s fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".\\nROSS: Look, don\\'t blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.\\nRACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?\\nMONICA: It\\'s work.\\nCHANDLER: I don\\'t know what to say. I\\'m sorry that we make more money than you. But we\\'re not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.\\nJOEY: And we don\\'t work hard?\\nMONICA:  Yeah, hi, it\\'s Monica. I just got a page.\\nCHANDLER: I\\'m just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.\\nJOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.\\nCHANDLER: Yes.\\nRACHEL: Oh!\\nCHANDLER: No.\\nMONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don\\'t understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I\\'ll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.\\nPHOEBE: Oh.\\nWAITRESS: Here\\'s your check. That\\'ll be $4.12.\\nJOEY: Let me get that.  You got five bucks?\\nMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.\\nJADE: Hi, it\\'s me. Listen, Bob. I\\'m probably way out of line here.

We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?\\nRACH: Oh, it ended very well.\\nPHOE: Oh.\\nMNCA:  Do not start without me. Do not start without me.\\nPHOE: Ok, all right, let\\'s hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a \"I gotta have you now\" kind of thing?\\nRACH: Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.\\nPHOE: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?\\nRACH: No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.\\nPHOE/MNCA: Ohhhh.\\nROSS: And, uh, and then I kissed her.\\nJOEY: Tongue?\\nROSS: Yeah.\\nJOEY: Cool.\\nCHAN: All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.\\nPHOE: Wow. What are you gonna use it for?\\nCHAN:  Games and stuff.\\nMNCA:  There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.\\nJOEY:  Wait, here\\'s one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?\\nMNCA: There\\'s an ad for a naked chef?\\nJOEY: No, but if you\\'re willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...\\nROSS: Hi.\\nPHOE: Hey, oh, so, um...how\\'d you make out last night?\\nROSS: That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that\\'s just painful\\nMNCA: Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.\\nROSS: Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie\\'s saline solution on my night table. And I\\'m thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I\\'m like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?\\nJOEY: You got all that from saline solution?\\nMNCA: We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.\\nROSS: Believe me, I\\'ve been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I\\'m with Julie, so it\\'s like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.\\nRACH:  Hey, you.\\nROSS: How are you?\\nRACH: Good. How are you?\\nROSS: Good.\\nJULIE: Hi, honey.\\nROSS: Hi, Julie.  Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?\\nJULIE: Good.\\nROSS:  Good, so everybody\\'s here. Everybody\\'s good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?\\nPHOE: Oh, well, actually.\\nROSS:  Play it.\\nPHOE: Ok, all right.\\nJOEY: Hey, Julie, I didn\\'t know you wore lenses.\\nJULIE: What?\\nROSS:  Ssshh.\\nPHOE: Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it\\'s called, um, \"Two of Them Kissed Last Night\".\\nPHOE:  There was a girl, we\\'ll call her Betty, and a guy let\\'s call him Neil. Now I can\\'t stress this point too strongly, this story isn\\'t real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we\\'ll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!\\nRTST: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.\\nMNCA: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn\\'t too clear.\\nRTST: Mockolate.\\nMNCA: I\\'m sorry?\\nRTST: Mockolate. It\\'s a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.\\nMNCA: Ohh.\\nRTST: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.\\nMNCA: All right. Mmm-mmm.\\nRTST: Yeah?\\nMNCA:  I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn\\'t do that.\\nRTST: No, ma\\'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.\\nMNCA:  Mmm-mmm.\\nRTST: But, we\\'re thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.\\nMNCA: Wow.\\nRTST: Aren\\'t you going to swallow that?\\nMNCA: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.\\nRTST: Yeah, isn\\'t that great?\\nMNCA:  Mmm.\\nRTST: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?\\nMNCA: Abso......lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.\\nRTST: Really?\\nMNCA: Especially the after taste, you know, I\\'ll tell ya, that\\'ll last ya till Christmas.\\nMNCA: How about Mockolate mousse?\\nPHOE: It\\'s not, it\\'s not very Thanksgiving-y.\\nMNCA: Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?\\nPHOE: What makes it pilgrim?\\nMNCA: We\\'ll put buckles on it.\\nRACH: Hey.\\nPHOE: Hey.\\nMNCA: Hey.\\nRACH: Did uh, Ross call?\\nMNCA: No, I\\'m sorry.\\nRACH: Why didn\\'t he call? He\\'s gonna stay with Julie, isn\\'t he? He\\'s gonna stay with her and she\\'s going to be all, \"Hi, I\\'m Julie, Ross picked me, and we\\'re gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.\"\\nPHOE: No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.\\nROSS: I don\\'t know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.\\nCHAN: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They\\'re both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet\\'s too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.\\nJOEY: Hey, here\\'s a thought, Ross.\\nCHAN: Don\\'t touch the computer. Don\\'t ever touch the computer.\\nJOEY: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.\\nCHAN: Ok, all right, look. Let\\'s get logical about this, ok? We\\'ll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We\\'ll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.\\nROSS: Can\\'t we just use a pen?\\nCHAN: No, Amish boy.\\nJOEY: Ok, let\\'s start with the cons, \\'cause they\\'re more fun. All right, Rachel first.\\nROSS: I don\\'t know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she\\'s a little spoiled sometimes.\\nJOEY: You could say that.\\nROSS: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she\\'s a little ditzy, you know. And I\\'ve seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common \\'cause we\\'re both paleontologists, but Rachel\\'s just a waitress.\\nCHAN: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?\\nROSS: I don\\'t know.\\nJOEY: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.\\nCHAN: Ok, let\\'s do Julie. What\\'s wrong with her?\\nROSS:  She\\'s not Rachel.\\nMNCA: Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.\\nRACH: Oh my god.\\nMNCA: Oh my god good?\\nRACH: Oh my god, I can\\'t believe you let me put this in my mouth.\\nPHOE: Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!\\nCHAN: I\\'m telling you this thing won\\'t print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?\\nJOEY:  Hey, so how\\'d it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?\\nROSS: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.\\nCHAN:  So, Spock actually hugs his father?\\nRACH: Hey, do you guys have......hi.\\nROSS: Hi.\\nRACH:  Where you goin\\'?\\nROSS: I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie\\'s.\\nRACH:  Oh.\\nROSS: No, no, uh, it\\'s not what you think. It\\'s um the other thing.\\nRACH: Well, what\\'s the other thing, what do I think?\\nROSS: Well, uh.\\nJOEY: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god\\'s sakes.\\nRACH: Really?\\nROSS: Really. It\\'s always been you, Rach.\\nRACH: Oh, god.\\nJOEY/CHAN: Ohhh.\\nRACH: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.\\nROSS: I know, I know, it\\'s, it\\'s almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?\\nRACH: Let me get my coat.\\nROSS: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I\\'ll get your coat.\\nRACH: Ok, he\\'s goin\\' to get my coat. He\\'s goin\\' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can\\'t believe this. This is unbelievable.  What\\'s that?\\nCHAN:  What? Nothing.\\nRACH: What\\'s that? What? I saw my name. What is it?\\nCHAN: No, no, see? See?  Hey, it\\'s printing!\\nRACH: Well what is it? Let me see.\\nROSS: Hey, someone order a coat?\\nRACH: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won\\'t let me see.\\nROSS: He won\\'t?  He won\\'t! Because, isn\\'t that, isn\\'t that the, the short story you were writing?\\nCHAN: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.\\nRACH: And I\\'m in it? Then let me read it.\\nCHAN, JOEY, ROSS: No!\\nRACH: Come on.\\nJOEY: Hey, uh, why don\\'t you read it to her?\\nCHAN:  \"It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. \\'Oh, look,\\' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.\"\\nROSS: That\\'s it? That\\'s all you wrote? You\\'re the worst writer in the whole world.\\nRACH: All right, you know what? This isn\\'t funny anymore. There\\'s something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.\\nROSS: No, you don\\'t.\\nRACH: All right, you know what, that\\'s fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that\\'s fine. I do not need to see it.\\nRACH: What is this? Ross, what is this?\\nCHAN: Good luck.\\nROSS: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?\\nRACH: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?\\nROSS: Now that\\'s a little spoiled. He was supposed to type \"little\", the idiot.\\nRACH: Just a waitress?\\nROSS: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?\\nRACH: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!\\nROSS: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie\\'s column.\\nRACH: She is not Rachem. What the hell\\'s a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn\\'t know because I\\'m just a waitress.\\nROSS: No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She\\'s not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?\\nCHAN: My diary! My diary, that\\'s brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.\\nMNCA: You know, that\\'s true. You\\'d be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.\\nPHOE: I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.\\nJOEY: Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler\\'s idea.\\nPHOE: What?\\nMNCA: What?\\nCHAN: Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.\\nMNCA: This was your idea?\\nPHOE: What were you thinking?\\nCHAN:  All right, let\\'s get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.\\nMNCA: Yeah. You!\\nCHAN: All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don\\'t you?\\nPHOE: Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.\\nROSS: Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!\\nRACH:  When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn\\'t mean please climb up the fire escape.\\nROSS: I just wanna read something. It\\'s your pro list.\\nRACH: Not interested.\\nROSS:  Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you\\'re nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.\\nROSS: Number six: the way you smell.\\nJOEY:  Hey, Ross! What are you doin\\'?\\nROSS: Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?\\nJOEY: Oh, yeah, I do.\\nCHAN: What are you doing out there?\\nROSS: I am, uh, I am...\\nMNCA: Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?\\nROSS: Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.\\nRACH: No.\\nROSS: No?\\nRACH: That\\'s what I said.\\nCHAN: Look, maybe we should go?\\nRACH: No, you guys, you really don\\'t have to go, we\\'re done talking.\\nROSS: Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.\\nRACH:  No, you don\\'t, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.\\nROSS: No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.\\nRACH: Oh, well, that\\'s, that\\'s mighty big of you, Ross.  I said don\\'t go!\\nROSS: You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there\\'s nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.\\nRACH: Well, then, I guess that\\'s the difference between us. See, I\\'d never make a list.\\nJOEY:  Maybe a little longer.\\nMNCA: Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I\\'ve indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.\\nRTST: Doesn\\'t matter.\\nMNCA: What?\\nRTST: Our FDA approval didn\\'t come through. Something about laboratory rats.\\nMNCA: Oh, gosh, I\\'m sorry.\\nRTST: Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.  Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn\\'t eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?\\nMNCA: Well, uh, I ate some.\\nRTST: Oh, some, that\\'s fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot.

Rachel, he wants you to know he\\'s deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.\\nRADIO: Uh, we\\'ve just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It\\'s pretty appalling, and Ross, if you\\'re listening, I don\\'t wanna play your song anymore. Why don\\'t we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle\\'s sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.\\nRTST: Hi, thanks for coming in again.\\nMNCA: Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.\\nRTST: It\\'s like I\\'m lookin\\' in a mirror. Anyway, they\\'re called \"fishtachios\". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they\\'re made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one.

I was really impressed, I was.\\nPHOE: Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.\\nJOEY: Here it is, here it is.

I got a callback for Thursday.\\nESTL: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?\\nJOEY: No.\\nESTL: Well, here it is.\\nJOEY: OK, uh.... listen, there\\'s something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...\\nESTL: Oh, isn\\'t Lori a doll?\\nJOEY: Oh yeah, yeah, she\\'s great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would\\'ve... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.\\nESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I\\'m just gonna put in a call here and we\\'ll find out what\\'s goin\\' on and straighten it out.  Yeah, you\\'re gonna have to sleep with her.\\nRACH: What\\'s the matter?\\nMNCA: It\\'s Fun Bobby.\\nRACH: What, isn\\'t he sober?\\nMNCA: Oh, he\\'s sober alright.

Did you hear the hammer story?\\nPHOE: OK, OK, don\\'t get all squinky.\\nRACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.\\nMNCA: But I\\'m gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can\\'t break up with him. I\\'m the one who made him quit drinking. He\\'s dull because of me.\\nPHOE: Alright, don\\'t say that. He\\'s probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.\\nRUSS: Hi.\\nCHAN:  Hey Ross.... bahhhh!\\nRACH: Hi Russ, I\\'ve just got two more tables to clean and then we\\'ll go, OK?\\nRUSS: OK, I\\'ll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.\\nPHOE: Rachel?

Russ, Ross.\\nRUSS: Hi.\\nROSS: Hi.\\nRUSS: Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel\\'s?\\nROSS: Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel\\'s?\\nRUSS: Actually, I\\'m a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel\\'s.\\nROSS: A date.\\nRUSS: Yeah, I\\'m her date.\\nROSS: Oh, oh, you\\'re... uh... you\\'re, oh you\\'re the date.\\nCHAN: You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.\\nRUSS: Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.\\nROSS: Yes, yes I am. And you are a....\\nRUSS: Periodontist.\\nMNCA: See? They\\'re as different as night and... later that night.\\nROSS: Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.\\nRUSS: Ditto.\\nROSS: I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.\\nRACH: Oh.\\nROSS: Hey, I didn\\'t know we were, uh, seeing other people.\\nRACH: Well, we\\'re not seeing each other, so....\\nROSS: Well, uh, for your information, there\\'s a woman at the museum, who\\'s curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who\\'s, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I\\'ve been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...\\nRACH: Well, yeah, this is the deal.\\nROSS: OK, well, um, have a nice evening.\\nRACH: Um, Russ, you ready?\\nRUSS: Yeah.\\nRACH: Bye.\\nMNCA: Bye.\\nPHOE: Bye.\\nROSS:  She\\'s dating.

God?\\nJOEY: Ten years I\\'ve been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That\\'s actually on television.\\nCHAN: So, what\\'re you gonna do?\\nJOEY: Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?\\nCHAN: Well, I... I\\'ve got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.\\nJOEY: I\\'ve never slept with someone for a part.\\nCHAN: Well is she...\\nJOEY: Sorry.\\nCHAN: It\\'s alright. Is she good-looking?\\nJOEY: Yeah, she\\'s totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I\\'d be buying her breakfast.  You know, after having slept with her.\\nCHAN: Y\\'know, maybe this isn\\'t such a big deal. Y\\'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y\\'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you\\'ve got Christmas.\\nJOEY: I just... I just don\\'t think that I want it that way though, y\\'know? I mean, let\\'s say I do make it, alright? I\\'m always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y\\'know, the Little General.\\nCHAN: Didn\\'t you used to call it the Little Major?\\nJOEY: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.\\nWAITER: Can I get you something from the bar?\\nMNCA: Yes, I would like something.  No, no thank you.\\nFBOB: If... if you want to drink, it\\'s OK with me, I\\'ve got to get used to it.\\nMNCA: No, no really. I.. I wouldn\\'t feel right about it.  Just some water.\\nFBOB: So the light went out in my refrigerator...\\nMNCA:  I\\'d like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.\\nCHAN: Hey, we\\'re having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.\\nRUSS: Dysprosium.\\nROSS:  Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.\\nCHAN: And weenie number two has it.

Other than their names being similar, I\\'m sorry, I do not see what you\\'re seeing.\\nROSS:  For your information, it\\'s a card sharp, not a card shark.\\nRUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.\\nCHAN: OK, I\\'m gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.\\nRUSS: I know what your problem is.\\nROSS: Oh you do, do you?\\nRUSS: Um-hum, you\\'re jealous.\\nROSS: Of... of what?\\nRUSS: You\\'re jealous because I\\'m a real doctor.\\nROSS: Hey, you\\'re a doctor of gums.

You want the job or not?\\nCHAN: Hey.\\nMNCA: Morning.\\nROSS: Where ya goin\\'?\\nMNCA: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?\\nROSS: Ooooohhhh.\\nPHOE: What\\'s with all the bottles of liquor?\\nROSS: What\\'s going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?\\nMNCA: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he\\'s still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.\\nRACH: Oh God, even his knock is boring.\\nMNCA: Hi. I\\'ll be ready in just a second.\\nFBOB: Uh, can I talk to you a minute?\\nMNCA: Sure.\\nFBOB: This is really hard for me to say.\\nMNCA: Oh God, you fell off the wagon.\\nFBOB: Oh, no, no, it\\'s about you.\\nMNCA: What about me?\\nFBOB: I think you may have a drinking problem.\\nMNCA: What these?  Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.\\nFBOB: Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?\\nMNCA: Oh... shoot.\\nFBOB: Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.\\nMNCA: OK.\\nMNCA: Take care.\\nFBOB: You too.\\nRACH: What happened?\\nMNCA: Well we... we kinda broke up.\\nGANG: Awwwwwwww.\\nMNCA:  Does anybody want these?\\nCHAN: I\\'ll take one.

I walked in there and she was all over me.\\nCHAN: So what\\'d you do?\\nJOEY: Well, I couldn\\'t do it. I told her I didn\\'t want to get the part that way.\\nROSS: Good for you.\\nJOEY: But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.\\nPHOE: So... and?\\nJOEY: Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!\\nGANG: Allright!\\nJOEY: Alright...

It\\'s about us.\\nROSS: Oh, you and me?\\nCAROL: Uh, no, Susan and me.\\nSUSAN: The other us.\\nROSS: Ok.\\nCAROL: We\\'re uh, we\\'re getting married.\\nROSS: As in, \"I now pronounce you wife and wife\" married?\\nCAROL: Anyway, we\\'d like you to come, but we totally understand if you don\\'t want to.\\nROSS: Why wouldn\\'t I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.\\nCAROL: Look I just thought that...\\nROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn\\'t I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn\\'t revel in your joy? I\\'m revelling baby, believe me!\\nSUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?\\nROSS: Mmm hmmm.\\nCAROL: Want us to go?\\nROSS: Uh-huh.\\nROSS: This is so cool. You\\'re actually gonna be on television.\\nJOEY: It really hit me last night. I\\'m gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin\\' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..\\nMONICA: Yes! Carol and Susan\\'s caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she\\'s in a full body cast.\\nROSS, CHANDLER & JOEY: Yes!\\nMONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I\\'ve never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn\\'t a problem for you, is it?\\nROSS: Would it matter?\\nMONICA: Oh, you are so great!  Thank you!\\nJOEY: Are you really not going?\\nROSS: I am really not going. I don\\'t get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?\\nMONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.\\nROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.\\nCHANDLER:  Who\\'s the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.\\nMONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.\\nROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She\\'s my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you\\'d expect me to be there.\\nJOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she\\'d be like the worst lesbian ever.\\nRACHEL:  Did I miss it? Did I miss it?\\nJOEY: No, I\\'m on right after this guy shoots himself.\\nCHANDLER: Whoa, she\\'s pretty.\\nJOEY: Yeah, and she\\'s really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.\\nRACHEL: I\\'m sorry, what?\\nMONICA: What?\\nJOEY: It\\'s like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you\\'re thinkin\\' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.\\nCHANDLER: Oh, ok.\\nJOEY: There\\'s my scene, there\\'s my scene.  \"Mrs. Wallace, I\\'m Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister\\'s neurosurgeon.\\nMRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?\\nJOEY: I\\'m afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.\\nCHANDLER: Nice!\\nRACHEL: That\\'s great!\\nROSS: Excellent!\\nCHANDLER: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin\\' to smell something.\\nROSS: That is so good! Do it again!\\nJOEY: All right, all right. \"Damnit Braverman, it\\'s right there on the chart!\"\\nCHANDLER: That\\'s great.

I couldn\\'t uh...\\nROSS: Is everything ok?\\nPHOEBE: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.\\nROSS: Oh my god.\\nCHANDLER: That\\'s a little more relaxed than you want them to get.\\nPHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.\\nMONICA: Oh, honey.\\nPHOEBE: Yeah, it\\'s just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \"ok, I\\'ll have some breakfast, and then I\\'ll take a little walk, and then I\\'ll have my massage.\" Little did she know God was thinking, \"Ok, but that\\'s it.\" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don\\'t think it went very far.\\nRACHEL: What do you mean?\\nPHOEBE: I think it went into me.\\nMONICA: God, this is so hard. I can\\'t decide between lamb or duck.\\nCHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would\\'ve been called Silence of the Ducks.\\nRACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?\\nROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.\\nCHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?\\nRACHEL: Oh god.\\nJOEY: I can\\'t believe you\\'re so uptight about your mom comin\\'.\\nRACHEL: I know, but it\\'s just it\\'s the first time, and I just don\\'t want her to think that because I didn\\'t marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?\\nPHOEBE:  Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.\\nJOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady\\'ll be with us?\\nPHOEBE: I don\\'t know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.  Sit up!\\nMRS. GREEN:  There she is.\\nRACHEL: Mom!\\nMRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it\\'s wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that\\'s the fun.\\nRACHEL: Pretty much.\\nMRS GREEN: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.\\nRACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.\\nMRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross.\\nROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green.\\nMRS GREEN: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?\\nRACHEL: Oh Mom!\\nMRS GREEN: If you didn\\'t pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.\\nCHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens.\\nMRS GREEN: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father\\'s house to the sorority house to my husband\\'s house. I am just so proud of you.\\nRACHEL: Really?\\nMRS GREEN: Yes.\\nPHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. \\'Course, that\\'s before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.\\nJOEY: Pheebs, who\\'s Evelyn Dermer?\\nPHOEBE: I don\\'t know. Who\\'s Soupy Sales?\\n[at Rachel and Monica\\'s\\nMRS GREEN: Oh my god, there\\'s an unattractive nude man playing the cello.\\nRACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he\\'s not playing a smaller instrument.\\nMRS GREEN:  You have some life here, sweetie.\\nRACHEL: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn\\'t marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?\\nMRS GREEN: I do. You didn\\'t love Barry. And I\\'ve never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.\\nRACHEL: For...me.\\nMRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.\\nRACHEL: Well, what do you mean?\\nMRS GREEN: I\\'m uh, considering leaving your father.\\nMONICA:  All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.\\nRACHEL: Oh god. I think I\\'m gonna be sick.\\nMONICA: Why? It\\'s not like I\\'m putting little nipples on them.\\nROSS: And you had no idea they weren\\'t getting along?\\nRACHEL: None.\\nJOEY: They didn\\'t fight a lot?\\nRACHEL: No! They didn\\'t even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?\\nPHOEBE:  In my day, divorce was not an option.\\nJOEY: Hey, look who\\'s up.\\nRACHEL: I just can\\'t believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody\\'s parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn\\'t have to worry about this.\\nMONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she\\'s doing it because she wants to be more like you.\\nRACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn\\'t she have just copied my haircut?\\nCHANDLER: You know, it\\'s funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it\\'s actually kinda true.\\nPHOEBE: That\\'s him.\\nCHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn\\'t come yet.\\nMR A: Phoebe?\\nPHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.\\nMR A: Oh, that\\'s all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.\\nPHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit?\\nMR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?\\nPHOEBE: I don\\'t know how to say this, but I think when your wife\\'s spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.\\nMR A: You\\'re saying, my wife is in you?\\nPHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don\\'t have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she\\'d be hanging around?\\nMR A: Well, I don\\'t know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.\\nPHOEBE: Everything?\\nMR A: Everything.\\nPHOEBE: Whoa, that\\'s a lot of stuff.\\nMR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.\\nPHOEBE: I\\'m sorry, there\\'s laughing in my head.\\nMR A:  Worth a shot, huh?\\nMRS GREEN: Look at this.\\nRACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.\\nMRS GREEN: Oh, look, here\\'s Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?\\nRACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he\\'s actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.\\nMONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don\\'t really need your help\"?\\nRACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, \"don\\'t touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.\"\\nMONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don\\'t think I planned enough time to actually do it.\\nRACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?\\nMONICA: If you want.\\nPHOEBE:  Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.\\nRACHEL: She\\'s still with you?\\nPHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn\\'t seen everything yet. I\\'ll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.  Oh, such a pretty face.\\nMRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?\\nRACHEL: God!\\nMONICA: All right, look, nobody\\'s smoking pot around all this food.\\nMRS GREEN: That\\'s fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what\\'s new in sex?\\nRACHEL: Oh! What\\'s new in sex?\\nMRS GREEN: The only man I\\'ve ever been with is your father.\\nMONICA: I\\'m dicing, I\\'m dicing, I don\\'t hear anything.\\nMRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.\\nRACHEL: Oh, I\\'m sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?\\nMRS GREEN: No.\\nRACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it?\\nMRS GREEN: No.\\nRACHEL: Then what? What do you want?\\nMRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.\\nRACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this?\\nMRS GREEN: You didn\\'t marry your Barry. I did.\\nRACHEL: Oh.\\nMONICA: All right people, we\\'re in trouble here. We\\'ve only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!\\nCHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.\\nMONICA: Joey, speed it up!\\nJOEY: I\\'m sorry, it\\'s the pigs. they\\'re reluctant to get in the blankets!\\nPHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.\\nMONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?\\nPHOEBE: Sir! No sir!\\nMONICA:  All right, you!\\nROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.\\nMONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don\\'t help me cook, I\\'m gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I\\'m gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.\\nCHANDLER: Hey! How come I\\'m stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.\\nMONICA: Hi.\\nCAROL: How\\'s it going?\\nMONICA: It\\'s goin\\' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.\\nCAROL: Fine, whatever.\\nROSS: What\\'s the matter?\\nCAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we\\'re calling off the wedding.\\nROSS: What?\\nMONICA: You\\'re still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.\\nROSS: Carol, what\\'s the matter? What happened?\\nCAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren\\'t coming.\\nROSS: Oh my god.\\nCAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they\\'re my parents. They\\'re supposed to give me away and everything.\\nROSS: It\\'s ok. I\\'m sorry.\\nCAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren\\'t doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn\\'t see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don\\'t know what to do.\\nROSS: I uh can\\'t believe I\\'m gonna say this, but I think Susan\\'s right.\\nCAROL: You do?\\nROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don\\'t have to be too emphatic about this.\\nCAROL: Of course I do.\\nROSS: Well then that\\'s it. And if George and Adelaide can\\'t accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn\\'t want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.\\nCAROL: You\\'re right. Of course you\\'re right.\\nMONICA: So we\\'re back on?\\nCAROL: We\\'re back on.\\nMONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can\\'t believe I lost 2 minutes.\\nJOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.\\nCHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.\\nPHOEBE:  Butterscotch? No one? All right, you\\'ll be sorry later.\\nCAROL: Thank you.\\nROSS: Any time.\\nCAROL: Ross.\\nMINISTER: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we\\'re gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.\\nPHOEBE:  Whoa, she\\'s gone. She\\'s gone. She\\'s gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.\\nMONICA: Would you look at them?\\nROSS: Yeah, can\\'t help but.\\nJOEY:  I wrapped those bad boys.\\nPHOEBE: I miss Rose.\\nCHANDLER: Oh, yeah?\\nPHOEBE: I know it\\'s kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.\\nWOMAN: You know, I uh, I couldn\\'t help but overhear what you just said, and I think it\\'s time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how \\'bout we go get you a drink?\\nPHOEBE: Ok, that\\'s so nice.\\nCHANDLER:\\nRACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun?\\nMRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I\\'m not saying it\\'s something I wanna pursue, but it\\'s nice to know I have options.\\nRACHEL: There\\'s more alcohol, right?\\nSUSAN: How you doin\\'?\\nROSS: Ok.\\nSUSAN: You did a good thing today.\\nROSS: Yeah.\\nSUSAN: You wanna dance?\\nROSS: No, that\\'s fine.\\nSUSAN: Come on. I\\'ll let you lead.\\nROSS: Ok.\\nCHANDLER:\\nMONICA: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?\\nROSS: Well, Mon, I was married.\\nPHOEBE: Yeah, me, too, technically.\\nRACHEL: I had a wedding.\\nMONICA: All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.\\nJOEY: I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?\\nCHANDLER: Isn\\'t Ben in this?\\nALL: Oh, yeah!\\nEND\\n======== 02-14\\nOriginally written by Alexa Junge.

Capital \\'T\\'!  Don\\'t worry, those are the right letters.\\nJoey: Look, what do you want me to say?\\nChandler: I want you to say that you like her!\\nJoey: I can\\'t. It\\'s like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.\\nChandler: Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!\\nJoey: Yeah, then-then who\\'s the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?\\nCommercial Break\\nRoss: How could you have told her?\\nRachel: Ross, I didn\\'t think it would that big of a deal.\\nRoss: Oh, she didn\\'t think it would be that big of deal.\\nRachel: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?\\nRoss: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.\\nRachel: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.\\nRoss: That\\'s different, okay. That\\'s like, uh \\'Who dated a stripper?\\' or \\'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?\\'.\\nRachel: Were both of those Joey?\\nRoss: Yeah. Look, you don\\'t, you don\\'t talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.\\nRachel: Not even with your best friend.\\nRoss: Noo!\\nRachel: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.\\nRoss: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?\\nRachel: Pretty much.\\nRoss: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?\\nRachel: Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.\\nRoss: I know, but it\\'s still worth mentioning, I think.\\nPhoebe:  Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.\\nMonica: Richard\\'s living room, drinking wine.\\nPhoebe: All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s my happy place.\\nPhoebe: Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I\\'m just gonna, I have to ask that you don\\'t move anything.\\nMonica: All right, I\\'ll try not to.\\nPhoebe: Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....\\nMonica: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?\\nPhoebe: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....\\nMonica: I\\'ll bet he\\'s totally over me, I\\'ll bet he\\'s fine.\\nPhoebe: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I\\'m sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....\\nMonica: Okay, this isn\\'t working. I\\'m still awake and now I have to pee.\\nJanice: So, I hear, you hate me!\\nJoey: I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.\\nJanice: A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.\\nJoey: And you got a \\'hate\\' from that?!

Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn\\'t breezy?\\nPhoebe: Well, how could it not be breezy, no, \\'cause, you\\'re, you\\'re in such a breezy place.\\nMonica: Here, I got it. I\\'ll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it\\'s breezy enough.\\nJoey: Monica, how are you gonna do that?\\nMonica: I know the code to his answering machine.\\nRoss: Okay, Mon, I really don\\'t think this is the...

I\\'m breezy.\"\\nJoey: Hey, you can\\'t say you\\'re breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.\\nWoman\\'s Voice:\\nJoey: Now she sounded breezy.\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: He\\'s seeing someone. I can\\'t believe he\\'s seeing someone.\\nPhoebe: Monica, you don\\'t know that.\\nMonica: Well, who\\'s voice was that?\\nChandler: Maybe it was his sister\\'s. You know, maybe it was his daughter\\'s.\\nMonica: Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?\\nRoss: Oh, great. It\\'s starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.\\nMonica: It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.\\nRachel: Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn\\'t work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!\\nRoss: You don\\'t, you don\\'t know what your wearing?\\nRachel: Well, hon-ey. I\\'m just trying to look nice for your big night.\\nRoss: Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I\\'ll just pick something out for you.\\nChandler: All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, \"Get out of my chair, dillhole!\"\\nJoey: Okay.\\nChandler: What are you doing?\\nJoey: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn\\'t say anything about the cushions.\\nChandler: The cushions are the essence of the chair!\\nJoey: That\\'s right! I\\'m taking the essence.\\nChandler: Oh-ho, it\\'ll be back. Oh-ho, there\\'s nobody in the room.\\nRoss: Look, I\\'m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.\\nRachel: Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.\\nRoss: Look, I didn\\'t recognize it without that inflatable sheep.\\nRachel: Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.\\nPhoebe: Oh Rach, good, listen isn\\'t this perfect for me!\\nRachel: Oh, it\\'s perfect! But not for tonight.\\nPhoebe: Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!\\nRoss: Not for tonight. Not for tonight!

Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?\\nChandler: He took my essence!\\nRoss: Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can\\'t you just wear the underwear you\\'re wearing now?\\nJoey: Because, I\\'m not wearing any underwear now.\\nRoss: Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?\\nJoey: It\\'s a rented tux. Okay. I\\'m not gonna go commando in another man\\'s fatigues.\\nChandler: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.\\nJoey: Okay, you hide my clothes. I\\'m gonna do the exact opposite to you.\\nChandler: What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?\\nJoey: Hey, opposite, is opposite!\\nChandler: He\\'s got nothing!\\nPhoebe:  Okay, I\\'m ready.\\nRoss and\\nPhoebe: Rachel, didn\\'t have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, \\'All right, fine I\\'ll be political.\\'\\nChandler: What are you supporting?\\nPhoebe: Duh!! Christmas!\\nRoss: Okay, hey, that\\'s okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  What time is it? It\\'s 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!\\nRachel:  Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?\\nRoss: Just, just, just pick one!\\nPhoebe: Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?\\nRachel: Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?\\nRoss: Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how \\'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don\\'t know what you\\'re trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don\\'t care if they match. I don\\'t care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.\\nRachel: But I...\\nRoss: No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.\\nRachel: All right.\\nRoss: Thank you!\\nMonica:  Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I\\'m sorry, I just have to.\\nRoss: It was, it was her voice.\\nChandler: Monica, I think you\\'ve gone over to the bad place.\\nMichelle:\\nMonica: Okay. That was her right?\\nPhoebe: Definitely.\\nMonica: See there you go. Woo! We\\'re out of the woods. Okay, I\\'ll get dressed now.\\nRoss: Yay!\\nPhoebe: I\\'ll get it, okay.  Oh, ew, it\\'s Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.\\nMonica:  Oh, you\\'re so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it\\'s that....\\nChandler:  You know what\\'s weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he\\'s getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?\\nMonica:  That bitch always hated me. I\\'m calling her back.\\nRoss: No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.\\nMonica: Okay, fine.\\nChandler: They got a phone in there, right?\\nPhoebe: Okay, we\\'re on it. We\\'re on it.\\nRoss: Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.\\nRachel: I\\'m not gonna gooo.\\nRoss: You\\'re not going to go.\\nRachel: No, I think I\\'m gonna catch up on my correspondence.\\nRoss: How, how, um how can you not be going?\\nRachel: I\\'m not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.\\nRoss: Um, you know, just out of curiosity...\\nRachel: Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I\\'m just, I don\\'t know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.\\nRoss: Right. Right, okay, okay. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry I yelled.\\nRachel: It\\'s fine.\\nRoss: No, but, your-your mad.\\nRachel: I\\'m not mad.\\nRoss: No.\\nRachel: I\\'m just not going.\\nRoss: Your not going.\\nRachel: Right.\\nRoss: Okay. You know that I-I have to go.\\nRachel: Um, hum.\\nRoss: Right. So is it gonna be like \\'I\\'m abandoning you while your upset.\\'\\nRachel: No.\\nRoss: No, because your not upset.\\nRachel: Right.\\nRoss: About the yelling.\\nRachel: Right, and the humiliating.\\nRoss: Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we\\'re okay.\\nRachel: Um, hum.\\nRoss: We\\'re good.\\nRachel: Right.\\nRoss: Okay. Honey?\\nRachel: Yes, Ross.\\nRoss: I love you.\\nPhoebe:  She\\'s just getting dressed.\\nChandler: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?\\nJoey: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I\\'m wearing everything you own.\\nChandler: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody\\'s underwear!!\\nJoey: Look at me! I\\'m Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn\\'t going commando...\\nChandler: Oooo-ooh!\\nJoey: Yeah. Whew, it\\'s hot with all of this stuff on.

Neither you can come to the party!\\nChandler: Jeez, what a baby.\\nJoey: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.\\nRoss: You know what I don\\'t care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she\\'s not even gonna go. Look Rach, I\\'m sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I\\'m sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.\\nJoey: You could drink the fat.\\nRoss: Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.\\nRachel: No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: I think you should drink the fat.\\nJoey: Yaaaay!\\nRoss: Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that\\'s what I\\'ll do.\\nPhoebe: Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That\\'s been sitting out.\\nRoss: I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.\\nRachel: No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don\\'t! I\\'ll go, I\\'ll go!\\nRoss: You will?!\\nRachel: You were really gonna do that, weren\\'t you?\\nRoss: Well, yeah.\\nRachel: You were gonna drink the fat.\\nJoey: Let\\'s see what else he\\'ll do!\\nRoss:  You, give him back his underwear!

When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.\\nRachel: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.\\nChandler: Okay, well. Janice said \\'Hi, do I look fat today?\\' And I, I looked at her....\\nRoss: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it\\'s just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?\\nRachel: Nooo!\\nRoss: And it works both ways.\\nChandler: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?\\nRachel: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.\\nRoss: Okay, for instance. Let\\'s say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she\\'ll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?\\nChandler: That\\'s easy, baggage claim.\\nRoss:  Wrong! Now you\\'re single. It\\'s actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.\\nChandler: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I\\'m all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.\\nRachel: Oh honey, I\\'m sorry we can\\'t help you there, \\'cause we\\'re cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I\\'m late for work.\\nRoss: Oh.\\nRachel: All right are you guys gonna come down?\\nRoss: Uh, yeah, yeah I\\'ll, I\\'m right behind you.\\nRachel: Good luck Chandler.\\nChandler: Thank you Rachel.\\nRoss: Bye sweetie.\\nRachel: Bye hon.\\nRoss:  Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.\\nChandler: Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.\\nRoss: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I\\'m like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you\\'re in bed...\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nRoss: I\\'m gonna use the cushion.\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nRoss: Okay, you\\'re in bed. She\\'s over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.\\nChandler: Okay, the old hug and roll.\\nRoss: Yep.\\nChandler: Okay, one question.\\nRoss: Shoot.\\nChandler: You\\'re pretending the pillow\\'s a girl right?\\nJoey: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?\\nRachel:  You\\'re so pretty.\\nPhoebe:  Hi!\\nAll: Hey, Phoebe.\\nPhoebe: Hey, oh, you know that guy who\\'s been following me? I talked to him today.\\nJoey:  You talked to him. Are you crazy?\\nPhoebe: Okay, first I\\'m not crazy. And second, say it don\\'t spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn\\'t following me, I mean he was, but \\'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that\\'s why, that\\'s why he couldn\\'t just come up and talk to me. \\'Cause of the restraining order.\\nChandler: Umm, not feeling better \\'bout Malcom.\\nPhoebe: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he\\'s not like a kook, no. He\\'s just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he\\'s so cute.\\nRoss: Oh my God, you\\'ve got a crush on your sister\\'s stalker.\\nPhoebe: No, I\\'m just gonna help him, you know, get \\'de-Ursula-ized\\', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.\\nJoey:\\nPhoebe: Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.\\nMonica:  Hey guys.\\nAll: Hey Mon.\\nMonica: Joey, this is for you.  It\\'s blackberry curin.\\nJoey: Aww.  Ohh!\\nChandler: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked\\nJoey: Put your hands together.\\nMonica: Joey, take your time with that. That\\'s my last batch.\\nJoey: No more jam?!\\nRachel: Well, what happened to your jam plan?\\nMonica: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I\\'ve got a new plan now. Babies.\\nChandler: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.\\nRoss: What are you talking about?\\nMonica: I\\'m talking about me having a baby.\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Are you serious?\\nMonica: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that\\'s when I came up with the baby plan.\\nRoss: Well, aren\\'t you forgetin\\' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy\\'s name? Dad!\\nMonica: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I\\'ll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that\\'s just stupid.\\nChandler: That, that\\'s what\\'s stupid.\\nMonica: I don\\'t need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.\\nRachel: Down at the docks again?\\nJanice: Night-night Bing-a-ling.\\nChandler: Night-night.....Janice.\\nCommercial Break\\nMalcom: Here\\'s my binoculars.\\nPhoebe: Oh, great. Great. You\\'re doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.\\nMalcom: These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I\\'m watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they\\'re just for fun.\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah. What\\'s this?\\nMalcom: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?\\nPhoebe: Um, not even a little bit.\\nMalcom: It\\'s about you.\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay then.\\nMalcom:  I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I\\'m such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.\\nPhoebe: Good. So what were you thinking?\\nMalcom: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.\\nPhoebe: Really?\\nMalcom: No.\\nPhoebe: Oh.\\nMalcom: See that\\'s just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay.\\nChandler: No, that\\'s all right. I just had a jar of mustard.\\nMonica:  Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he\\'s 6\\'2\", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.\\nChandler: You mean there\\'s more than one of us.\\nRoss: Look, you can\\'t do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna.....\\nMonica: You\\'re gonna what?\\nRoss: I\\'m gonna tell Mom.\\nRachel: Honey, I\\'m sorry, but he\\'s right. I love you, but you\\'re crazy.\\nRoss: Crazy.\\nMonica: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn\\'t the ideal way to something....\\nRoss:  Oh, it\\'s not the ideal way...\\nMonica: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I\\'m so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?\\nJoey: Check it out!! Jam crackers!\\nMonica: Okay, all right, how\\'s this? 27. Italian-American guy. He\\'s an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he\\'s the only....boy.  Oh my God, under personal comments: \\'New York Knicks, rule!\\'\\nJoey: Yeah, the Knicks rule!\\nMonica: Joey, this is you!\\nJoey: Let me see.  Oh, right.\\nRachel: When did you go to a sperm bank?\\nJoey: Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?\\nChandler: And that\\'s how you bought it?\\nJoey: Noooo, that\\'s what I was wearing when I donated. I\\'m kinda surprised there\\'s any of my boys left.\\nMonica: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I\\'ve got an actual rocket scientist here.\\nJoey: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my \\'Days of Our Lives\\' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.\\nPhoebe:  Hellooo!\\nAll: Hey.\\nRoss: How\\'s the maniac?\\nPhoebe: Oh, well he\\'s yummy. We did a little kissin\\'.\\nRachel: Phoebe, what are you doing?\\nPhoebe: Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he\\'s not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.\\nRachel: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don\\'t just give up something like that.\\nPhoebe: Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.\\nRoss: You\\'re taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?\\nPhoebe: What, he\\'s not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?\\nChandler: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.\\nPhoebe: What are you saying I should do?\\nMonica: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.\\nPhoebe: Thank you, Monica.\\nJoey: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.\\nMonica: Oh, that\\'s what I would do, forget mine.\\nRachel: Oh my God, what happened?\\nJanice: Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!\\nRachel: Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.\\nJanice: Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross\\'s Hug and Roll thing.\\nRachel:  Ross\\'s what?\\nJanice: You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.\\nMalcom: Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Yes? Yes! Oh.\\nMalcom: What are you doing?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.\\nMalcom: Were you following me?\\nPhoebe: Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.\\nMalcom: So you spied on me. I can\\'t believe you don\\'t trust me.\\nPhoebe: Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin\\' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?\\nMalcom: I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn\\'t. I\\'m so pathetic.\\nPhoebe: No, no, it\\'s not your fault. You know it\\'s partly my fault, \\'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can\\'t date you anymore, \\'cause your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh?

Brown hair, green eyes...\\nJoey: No kiddin\\', hmm.\\nMonica: What?\\nJoey: No, I-I figured you would\\'ve picked a blond guy.\\nMonica: Really? Why?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.\\nMonica: Hoyt?\\nJoey: It\\'s a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.\\nMonica: Really, is he a swimmer?\\nJoey: He\\'s got the body for it.\\nMonica: I like that.  What?\\nJoey: You guys have one of those signs that says: \\'We don\\'t swim in your toilet, so don\\'t pee in our pool.\\', you know.\\nMonica: We do not have one of those signs.\\nJoey: Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.\\nMonica: Two girls and a boy?\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nMonica: And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they\\'re, they\\'re running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.\\nJoey: Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too.\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nJoey: Oh Monica. .\\nClosing Credits\\nJoey: I called the sperm bank today, they haven\\'t sold a single unit of Tribianni.

What\\'s up?\\nRoss: Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!\\nEnd\\n======== 03-04\\nHost: Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!\\nPhoebe: Oh, oh! It\\'s on again!\\nJoey: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.\\nAll: Shhhh!\\nHost: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin\\'-flangin\\' hard to open.\\nJoey:  Aw! There\\'s got to be a better way!\\nMike: And there is Kevin.\\nJoey: Can we please turn this off?\\nRachel: Noo way, Kevin.\\nMike: There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you\\'ll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.\\nRoss:  Are you intrigued?\\nChandler: You\\'re flingin\\'-flangin\\' right I am!\\nMike: Keep in mind, he\\'s never used this product before, you\\'re gonna see how easy this is to do.  This works with any milk carton.\\nJoey:  Now, I can have milk everyday.\\nOpening Credits\\nChandler: Well, it\\'s official there are no good movies.\\nJanice: Well, let\\'s go to a bad one and make out.\\nMonica: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.\\nJoey:  Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nChandler: Hey, man. What\\'s up?\\nJoey: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn\\'t show up at the audition I didn\\'t know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!\\nChandler: Well, I\\'ll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn\\'t me.\\nPhoebe: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!\\nJoey: How is it you?\\nPhoebe: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn\\'t found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.\\nJoey: Yep, that\\'s my audition.\\nMonica: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.\\nPhoebe: Yep, and that\\'s why we don\\'t invite you to play.\\nJanice: What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.\\nJoey: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.\\nPhoebe: That is unfair. I\\'ll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.\\nJoey: Pheebs, you can\\'t do that. The casting director doesn\\'t talk to friends, she only talks to agents.\\nPhoebe: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .\\nJoey: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?\\nPhoebe: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  \\'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay\\'s office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she\\'ll know what it\\'s about.\\'\\nJoey: Hang up, hang up.\\nPhoebe:  \\'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.\\'\\nChandler: Is anybody else scared?\\nPhoebe:\\nChandler: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!\\nMonica: Oh, now you want a pad.\\nCarol and Susan:  Hey!!\\nRoss: There\\'s my boy! Here\\'s my boy! And here\\'s his Barbi  What\\'s ah, what\\'s my boy doing with a Barbi?\\nCarol: He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.\\nSusan: He carries it everywhere, it\\'s like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.\\nRoss: Yeah, it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?\\nSusan: So he\\'s got a doll? So what? Unless you\\'re afraid he\\'s gonna grow up and be in show business.\\nCarol: This doesn\\'t have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?\\nRoss: You know what it\\'s fine. If you\\'re okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.\\nRoss: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how \\'bout, don\\'t you want to play with the monster truck?\\nRachel: Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can\\'t your son just play with his doll?\\nMonica:  I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?\\nJoey: I love that movie.\\nMonica: There it is. Joey, what are you doing?\\nJoey: I\\'m sorry, it just felt nice.\\nChandler:  Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.\\nJoey: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.\\nChandler: Just do it! Okay, it\\'s Janice and if I get it I\\'m going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that\\'s great I\\'m gonna have to see her tonight.\\nRachel: What\\'s the big deal? Why don\\'t you wanna see Janice?\\nChandler: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.\\nRoss: And that\\'s bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?\\nChandler: Noo.\\nRoss: You didn\\'t want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.\\nChandler: No, it\\'s like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: \\'Run for your life! Get out of the building!\\'\\nRachel: Men are unbelievable.\\nMonica: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?\\nChandler: I know, that,  that\\'s why I don\\'t want to go tonight, I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to say something stupid.\\nMonica: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.\\nJoey: Hey, you know about that?!\\nChandler: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don\\'t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!\\nRoss:  Where there is no fear of commitment.\\nChandler: Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?\\nJoey: Well, I\\'ve never been through the tunnel myself, \\'cause as I understand it, you\\'re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it\\'s pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you\\'re afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.\\nRachel: Amazingly, that makes sense.\\nChandler: You think?\\nJoey: Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!\\nChandler: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I\\'m staring down the barrel of a gun, I\\'m pretty much peeing every which way.\\nPhoebe: Oh, it\\'s your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?\\nRachel: Sure Pheebs, you know, that\\'s what it\\'s there for, emergencies and pretend agents.\\nJoey: Come on baby, come on!\\nPhoebe:  \\'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she\\'s in her car I\\'ll have to patch you through.\\'\\nRachel: Very nice touch.\\nPhoebe:  Op, went through a tunnel.\\nRachel: Unbelievable.\\nJoey: Thank you so much.\\nPhoebe: It was really fun, I mean I\\'ve never talked on a car phone before.\\nJoey: You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there\\'s this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn\\'t get me in.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I don\\'t know. I mean it was fun one time.\\nJoey: Come on, please, it\\'ll be just this one more, well actually it\\'s two.\\nPhoebe: Two?\\nJoey: Yeah! Well, well really it\\'s three. Please. You\\'re so good at it. I love you.\\nPhoebe: Okay, I\\'ll do it, but just these three, right\\nJoey: Nooo, four.\\nJanice: So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?\\nChandler: \\'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.\\nJanice: Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you\\'re sleeping with gives you contact paper.\\nChandler: Well, wait there\\'s, there\\'s more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.\\nJanice: Oh, you didn\\'t have to do this.\\nChandler: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you\\'re my girlfriend, and that\\'s what girlfriends should, should get.\\nJanice: Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would\\'ve thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.\\nChandler: Well, not me. But that\\'s what\\'s happened, and, ah, and, and there\\'s more. We should take a trip.\\nJanice: We should?\\nChandler: Yep, we\\'re a couple and that\\'s what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!\\nJanice:  I don\\'t think we need to, because you\\'re tripping me out right now! Are you okay?\\nChandler: I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I\\'m here it\\'s like what was the big deal. I could probably say \\'Let\\'s move in together.\\' and I\\'d be okay.\\nJanice: You probably want us to move in together?\\nChandler: It doesn\\'t scare me!\\nJanice: Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you\\'re talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn\\'t even that hungry. You know what, it\\'s getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...\\nChandler: Oh, no, no, no, don\\'t go! I\\'ve scared ya\\'! I\\'ve said too much! I\\'m hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: Honey, this will help.\\nChandler: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.\\nRachel and Monica: Uff.\\nMonica: That is never good.\\nChandler: Then I got all needy and clingy.\\nRachel: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it\\'s not so bad. How did you leave it?\\nChandler: She said she\\'d call me.\\nRachel and Monica: Ohh!\\nChandler: Oh God.\\nMonica: Welcome to our side of the tunnel.\\nChandler: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.\\nRachel: Yeah, well that\\'s that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.\\nMonica: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.\\nRachel: Yeah, you do.\\nChandler: So, you don\\'t think I\\'m terminal?\\nMonica: Well, no, not at all, you\\'re not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.\\nChandler: Okay, okay. So, should I call her?\\nRachel and Monica: Nooo!\\nRachel: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.\\nMonica: She has to know that your not ready.\\nRachel: Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.\\nChandler: So I\\'m not, not gonna lose her?\\nRachel: Oooh, honey, you\\'re not a total loser.\\nChandler: I said, \\'So I\\'m not gonna lose her?\\'\\nRachel: Oh.\\nRoss: Guess who\\'s here. It\\'s the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  \\'A real American hero. I\\'m G.I. Joe!\\' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.\\nRachel: G.I. Joe? Do you really think he\\'s gonna fall for that?\\nJoey:  G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?\\nRoss: Look Ben, it\\'s a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!\\nJoey and Ross: Go Joe!!!\\nPhoebe:\\nJoey: Pheebs! There you are!\\nPhoebe: No it\\'s not, sorry.\\nJoey: But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn\\'t recognize you wearing, in those....pants.\\nJoey: Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.\\nPhoebe: Yes! They called and you didn\\'t get it! Okay, I mean you didn\\'t get it, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.\\nJoey: It\\'s okay, these things happen.\\nPhoebe: But they shouldn\\'t happen, you know what, you\\'re, you\\'re in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don\\'t wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.\\nJoey: I\\'m, I\\'m okay. See.\\nPhoebe: Oh, now you\\'re sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I\\'m sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.\\nJoey: No! No, no you can\\'t quit! You\\'re the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can\\'t take it personally.\\nPhoebe: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.\\nJoey: They actually said that?\\nPhoebe: Yeah. Ooh God, there\\'s that face again! See I can\\'t do this job! I...\\nJoey: No, no, no, see that\\'s why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like \\'They went another way\\', but this, I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.\\nPhoebe: Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.\\nRoss:\\nJanice:  Chandler!\\nChandler:  Hello, Janice.\\nJanice: What are you doing here?\\nChandler:  Oh, just a bit of shopping. How\\'ve you been?\\nJanice: Are you being British?!\\nChandler:  No. Not anymore.\\nJanice: Why are you shopping here? You don\\'t live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?\\nChandler: Yeah, huh. I\\'m just uh, you know I\\'m just picking up some things for a party.\\nJanice: Barley? What kind of party serves barley?\\nChandler: Well, I\\'m sorry if my friends aren\\'t as sophisticated as yours.\\nJanice: Where is this party?\\nChandler: Here in Chelsea.\\nJanice: Who\\'s party is it?\\nChandler: A woman\\'s\\nJanice: What woman?!\\nChandler:  Chelsea.\\nJanice: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.

Oh.\\nMonica:  So! I\\'m just an empty vase, huh?\\nJulio: What?\\nMonica: Y\\'know, so I don\\'t read as many important books as you do, and I don\\'t write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y\\'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y\\'know but that does not mean that I\\'m empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.\\nJulio: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\nMonica: You don\\'t even know me...\\nJulio: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.\\nMonica: What?\\nJulio: The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, my friend Phoebe...\\nJulio: No, it\\'s about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?\\nMonica:  Oh yeah.\\nDirector: All right, let\\'s do it!\\nDirector: No, no, no. What was that?\\nJoey: I know, it was the best I could get out of them.\\nDirector: Well, people!\\nJoey: People, people, people.\\nDirector: Let\\'s try it again, and this time let\\'s watch everybody watch Joey.  Count it off.\\nRachel: So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?\\nChandler: Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got.  See, she\\'s fully dressed, right?\\nRachel: Right.\\nChandler: And then you click it and, uh-oh, she\\'s naked. And then, and then you click it again and she\\'s dressed. She\\'s a business woman, she\\'s walking down the street, she\\'s window shopping, and\\nRoss:  Hi.\\nRachel: Hello.\\nChandler: Y\\'know what, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna spend some alone time with the pen.\\nRoss:  I\\'m sorry, I was an idiot.\\nRachel: A big idiot.\\nRoss: A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.\\nRachel: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we\\'ve been together for almost a year now?\\nRoss: Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it\\'s possible I think I love you even more. So, it\\'s hard for me to believe that I\\'m not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.\\nGunther: Let it be me! Let it be me!\\nRachel: Honey, that\\'s very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there\\'s no reason to be jealous.\\nRoss: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.\\nChandler: Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?\\nRachel: Where ya going?\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'ve got to go pick up Ben, we\\'ve got a play date this afternoon.\\nRachel: Ohh, with who?\\nRoss: Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.\\nRachel: There was a woman at the...  The stripper?!\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nRachel: You have a play date with a stripper?!\\nChandler: Man, I gotta get a kid.\\nRoss: Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y\\'know, did her thing. And it turns out she\\'s got a boy about Ben\\'s age, so we\\'re taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?\\nRachel: Sure, is she married?\\nRoss: Ahh, no.\\nRachel: Oh.\\nRoss: Are you jealous?\\nRachel: Noo, I y\\'know I don\\'t see why she has to play with you, that\\'s all. I mean doesn\\'t she have any y\\'know other stripper moms friends of her own?\\nRoss: You are totally jealous.\\nRachel: I\\'m not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y\\'know about strippers. And y\\'know, and um, I...\\nRoss: Honey, I love you too.\\nRachel: Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.\\nRoss: What?\\nRoss: Huh.\\nRachel:  Well, there\\'s a kiss that he won\\'t forget for a couple of hours, y\\'know.\\nChandler: Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.\\nClosing Credits\\nMan:  Is there a Julio here?\\nJulio:  I am Julio.\\nMan:  you think there\\'s no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.\\nQuartet: Your no God\\'s gift to women, that\\'s all in your headdddd.

Thanks.\\nPhoebe: Now what is Fabutec?\\nMonica: Okay, all right dont judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....\\nPhoebe: Waxine!!\\nMonica: Yes! Have you seen it?\\nPhoebe: Oh, its incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.\\nMonica: I know!!\\nPhoebe: God. Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do that?\\nMonica: Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!\\nPhoebe: They have the best stuff in there.\\nChandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!\\nJoey: Yeah. We figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?\\nRoss: You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell her what I did.\\nChandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?\\nRoss: What?! Look, were trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?\\nJoey: Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.\\nChandler: Hes right. Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her.\\nJoey: Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.\\nRoss: Yeah, but dont you think....\\nChandler: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.\\nRoss: Yeah, okay.\\nJoey: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?\\nRoss: What trail?\\nJoey:  You always have to think about the trail!\\nRoss: Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail.\\nChandler: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issacs sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebes friends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it!\\nPhoebe:  After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,\\nMonica: Did that!\\nPhoebe: Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.\\nMonica: Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!\\nPhoebe: Was it not pain-free?\\nMonica: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.\\nPhoebe: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.\\nMonica: Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y\\'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.\\nPhoebe:  Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!\\nMonica: Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?\\nRoss:  Chloe? Hi..\\nChloe: Is this about me taking your watch?\\nRoss: You took my watch?\\nChloe: Im sorry, I do that.\\nRoss: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?\\nChloe: Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y\\'know.\\nRoss: Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?\\nChloe: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.\\nRoss: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y\\'know we havent actually met...\\nIssac: You dog!\\nRoss: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.\\nIssac: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.\\nRoss: Yeah, thats the one. Listen, I dont want to hurt her.\\nIssac: Oh, hey, man I know, doesnt matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.\\nRoss: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?\\nIssac: Aw, no problem dude. Y\\'know we got to look out for each other. Were the same, you and me.\\nRoss: Actually, no, were not.\\nIssac: Yeah, we are.\\nRoss: No, were not.\\nIssac: Yeah, we are.\\nRoss: No, were not!!\\nIssac: Okay, were not.\\nRoss: Right.\\nIssac: But, we are.\\nRoss: Fine. I just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister.\\nIssac: I can promise not to tell her again.\\nRoss:  Jasmine?\\nJasmine: Uh-huh.\\nRoss: We met at Phoebes birthday party, Im, Im Ross Geller.\\nJasmine: You did a bad thing!\\nRoss: Yes, I did.\\nJasmine: Very bad!\\nRoss: Very bad.\\nJasmine: Very, very bad.\\nRoss: Im agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?\\nJasmine: No.\\nRoss: Okay, Jasmine, please, please dont. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?\\nJasmine: All right.\\nRoss: Thank you, thank you.\\nJasmine: But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.\\nRoss:  Whos your roommate?\\nRoss: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.\\nGunther: Im sorry. Was I not supposed to?\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: Ow!\\nPhoebe: Oh!!\\nMonica: Ow!! Ow!!\\nPhoebe: Ow!!!\\nMonica and Phoebe: Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!\\nPhoebe: Were all right.\\nMonica: Its okay, its okay.\\nPhoebe: Were all right.\\nMonica: We were just waxing our legs.\\nChandler: Off?!!\\nPhoebe: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.\\nChandler: Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.\\nJoey: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, thats all. I mean, come on, its just a little wax.\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, come here.\\nChandler: Oh, thats mature.\\nJoey: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh.\\nMonica: Thats right.\\nRoss:  Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!\\nRachel: I cant talk to you. I cant even look at you right now!\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: Nothing, nothing.\\nMonica:  Rachel said everything was okay.\\nPhoebe:  What, what are they talking about?\\nRoss: Rachel?\\nRachel: Just get away from me!\\nRoss: No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?\\nRachel: A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!\\nPhoebe: Whe-where did he put it?!\\nRachel: Ross, you had sex with another woman!\\nMonica: Oh my God.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.\\nChandler: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....\\nMonica: Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?!\\nChandler:  He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.\\nRachel:  Y\\'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!\\nRoss: No!!\\nRachel: Just get out! Now!!\\nRoss: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.\\nRachel: Okay! All right! How was she?\\nChandler: Uh-oh.\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Was she good?\\nJoey: Dont answer that.\\nRachel: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk about it!! How was she?\\nRoss: She was...\\nJoey: Awful! Horrible!\\nChandler: She was not good. Not good.\\nJoey: She was nothing compared to you.\\nRoss: She, she was different.\\nJoey: Ewwwww!\\nChandler: Uh-oh.\\nRachel: Good different?\\nRoss: Nobody likes change.\\nRoss: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.\\nPhoebe: Should we do something?\\nChandler: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.\\nRoss: Im sorry, okay, Im sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.\\nRachel: Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!\\nRoss: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!\\nRachel: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!\\nRoss: Look, I didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.\\nRachel: We were on a break!\\nRoss: That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.\\nRachel: You think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality?\\nRoss: Look, Im not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!\\nRachel: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!\\nJoey: Y\\'know what, I dont think we should listen to this anymore.\\nMonica:  What, what are you doing? You cant go out there.\\nJoey: Why not?!  Im hungry.\\nMonica: Because theyll know weve been listening.\\nRachel: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!\\nRoss: Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didnt happen!\\nRachel: Oh, that is so sweet. I think Im falling in love with you all over again.\\nChandler: Y\\'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.\\nJoey: Yeah, well be fine.\\nRoss: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.\\nChandler:  Wax the door shut, were never leaving, ever.\\nPhoebe: Hi, its Phoebe.

Lets say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?\\nRoss:  Yes I would.\\nRachel: Youd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?\\nRoss:  Yes.\\nRachel: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....\\nRoss:  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

Hi honey.\\nHoshi: All right, on the table.\\nMonica: Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I dont want you to get hurt, cause I kinda like you.\\nPete: Oh, believe me, I dont want to get hurt either. Im being smart about this. See these guys? Theyre the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.  A house painter! He used to be a house painter.\\nMonica: Promise me youll be careful.\\nPete: I promise.\\nMonica: Hey, are we still on for tonight?\\nPete: Yeah.\\nMonica: Okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...\\nHoshi: No! No boom-boom before big fight!\\nMonica: How bout just a boom?\\nRachel:  Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?\\nPhoebe: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.\\nBonnie: Hi!\\nRachel: This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie?\\nBonnie: I can show you an ID if you want?\\nRachel: Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.\\nBonnie: Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.\\nRachel: Oh, that must be it.\\nPhoebe:  Well I hope you have fun tonight.\\nBonnie: Thanks! You too.\\nRachel:  You said she was bald.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.\\nRachel: How could you not tell me that she has hair?\\nPhoebe: I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.\\nRachel:  Ohh, well, this is just perfect!\\nPhoebe: Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.\\nRachel: Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y\\'know, that girl has hair got all over head!\\nPhoebe: Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her personality.\\nRachel: Why, does she have a bad personality?\\nPhoebe: Oh no, Bonnies the best!\\nDoug: Bing!\\nChandler:  What is with him?\\nPhil: With him? Youre is favourite, youre his guy!\\nStevens: We never get smacked.\\nChandler: Well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once.\\nPhil: Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.\\nStevens: Im telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.\\nDoug:  Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?\\nChandler: No sir.\\nDoug: There you go.\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nMonica: God Ross, what is that?\\nRoss: Yeah, its the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!\\nAnnouncer: From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut!

Hes a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!\\nMonica:  Pete! Pete!!

Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.\\nPete: It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant You suck!\\nMonica: I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.\\nPete: What, look back?\\nMonica: Well, youre not gonna get going are you?\\nPete: Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?\\nMonica: Well, no. But...\\nPete: Well Im not gonna stop until Im the Ultimate Fighting Champion.\\nMonica: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!\\nPete: Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dads garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.\\nMonica: You didnt know that already?\\nPete: Look, Im gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.\\nMonica: Okay, just get a lot better.  Fast.\\nPete: Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.\\nMonica: Yeah. That-that was the problem.\\nMonica:  Hey.\\nRoss: Hey! How long until Petes fight?\\nMonica: Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.\\nRoss: Hot dog?\\nMonica: Four, please.\\nPhoebe: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?\\nRoss: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.\\nPhoebe: Ohh, thats too bad!\\nRoss: No, I-Im saying I liked her.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, y\\'know what, there are other fish in the sea.\\nRoss: Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.\\nPhoebe: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?\\nChandler:  Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?\\nRoss: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.\\nJoey:  Hey, the fights starting!\\nRoss: Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?\\nChandler: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.\\nJoey:  Fights over!\\nChandler: Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!\\nDoug:  Bing! You got those numbers for me?\\nChandler: No, I ah, I didnt do them.\\nDoug: Oh, you forgot?\\nChandler: No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.\\nDoug: Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  Bing!\\nChandler: Doug!!\\nDoug: Hmm.\\nChandler: Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.\\nDoug: Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!\\nChandler: No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.\\nDoug: Oh?\\nChandler: Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Its just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous.\\nDoug: Well, say no more. Y\\'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! Youre okay.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nDoug: Ha!  Ahhhhhhh!\\nChandler: Ahhhhh!\\nPhoebe: Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?\\nRachel:  Oh my God! Phoebe look, its Ross and that girl.\\nPhoebe: No! No! Look at that!  Its a line of ants! Theyre working as a team!\\nRachel: Phoebe!\\nPhoebe:  Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Lets go.\\nRachel: Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay thats, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, thats what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...\\nPhoebe: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.\\nRachel: Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.\\nPhoebe: You said it was okay!\\nRachel: You said she was bald!!\\nPhoebe: What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!\\nRachel: Phoebe, we cant, we just cant just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!\\nPhoebe: Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I dont get it. Arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with Ross?\\nRachel:  Yes.\\nPhoebe: Well isnt he your friend? Dont you want him to be happy?\\nRachel: Yes.\\nPhoebe: So?\\nRachel: I just y\\'know, I didnt expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!\\nPhoebe:  Oh no.\\nRachel: What?\\nPhoebe: Oh, we killed them all.\\nRachel: Oh!\\nPete: Its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution. Ah, Im not supposed to move my spine.\\nMonica: Please tell me youre stopping now.\\nPete: Im fine! Id fight tonight, if theyd let me.  See this circle Im marking off here? This is my zone of terror.\\nMonica: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!\\nPete: I cant until Im the ultimate fighter. I will do it. Im telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, Im not saying I could beat Superman, but y\\'know, kids are stupid.\\nMonica: Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!\\nPete: Y\\'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adams Apple, but that really hurt.\\nMonica: Well then, y\\'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it without me.\\nPete: Well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be someone Im not. Ive got to do this.\\nMonica: Then Ive gotta go. Bye.\\nPete: Mon-Monica?\\nMonica: Yes?\\nPete: Could you leave a note? Cause Im on a lot of pain killers now, and I dont know if Ill remember this tomorrow.\\nDoug: So, in conclusion, the lines all go up\\nChandler: Thank you, sir.\\nStevens:  Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y\\'know, by accident.\\nDoug: Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard!  Well, what about you? Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?\\nChandler: No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.\\nDoug: Everybody else got one, and you want one too.

How could that still bother you?\\nRachel: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!\\nMonica: Look, you and I went to different high schools...\\nRachel: Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.\\nMonica: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.\\nRachel:  They had to have that specially made?!\\nMonica: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.\\nRachel:  Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!\\nMonica: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.\\nRachel: Oh, you go out with him.\\nMonica: Oh, really?!\\nRachel: Yeah.

Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and well call that pulling a Monica.\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight As, his parents would say, \"Yeah, he pulled a Monica.\" Y\\'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, \"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica.\" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, \"Yeah, that ones outta here.\" Though some things dont change.\\nMonica:  All right, Ill go down there. But, Im not gonna serve the lasagna. Im gonna serve something I make.\\nPhoebe: Wow! My breasts are really strong.\\nRachel: Chandler!

Well, then you\\'d better keep it away from Ross\\'s hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?\\nChandler: Oh, it wasn\\'t a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author\\'s grandchildren.\\nRachel: Oh, honey, that\\'s so sweet.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, and what a great way to say, \"I secretly love you, roommate\\'s girlfriend!\"\\nChandler: It doesn\\'t say that. Does it?\\nRoss: How do you think it\\'s gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?\\nChandler: Okay, all right, I\\'ll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!\\nMonica:  I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.\\nRachel: Oh my God! What happened?\\nMonica: Sixty guests.\\nRoss: So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?\\nMonica: Because I don\\'t have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there\\'s no way.\\nPhoebe: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican\\'t , not Monican...  ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?\\nMonica: I don\\'t know.\\nPhoebe: There you go, that\\'s the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!\\nMonica: Really? Cause I\\'d need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.\\nPhoebe: Okay! It\\'s worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven\\'t worked in months.\\nMonica: Well, you\\'re not working either.\\nPhoebe: Yes, but I\\'m doing this.\\nMonica: Yeah, that\\'d be great! Thank you!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nEveryone: Hey.\\nKathy: Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?\\nJoey: Why?\\nJoey: You can pee here!\\nKathy: Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.\\nChandler: It\\'s okay, the duck\\'s using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?\\nJoey: We\\'ve only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?\\nEveryone: Yeah!\\nRachel: Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.\\nJoey: Oh, I know...\\nRachel: And not one of your coupons for an hour of \"Joey Love.\"\\nPhoebe: Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?\\nRachel: No! I\\'m sorry, honey, it\\'s just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.\\nPhoebe: Fine. But you can\\'t help me develop my new universal language.\\nMonica: Hey!\\nRachel: Hey, how\\'d it go?\\nMonica: Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrowthe dead-guy-from-today\\'s best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!\\nPhoebe: Mon! I\\'m so happy for you!\\nMonica: Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I\\'m an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!\\nPhoebe: I\\'ll have one, please. Plus my money.\\nMonica: Oh. Well, I didn\\'t realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But lookI\\'ve got another job tomorrow, so I\\'ll pay you back with the money I make from that.\\nPhoebe: Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.\\nMonica: Okay.\\nRoss:  Huh...\\nCheryl: Um, would you like to come in?\\nRoss: Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?\\nCheryl: According to recent findings!\\nCheryl:  Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!\\nRoss: Mitzi is.....\\nCheryl: My hamster. I hope she\\'s okay, I haven\\'t seen her in a while. Have a seat.\\nRoss:  ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?\\nCheryl: What?\\nRoss: Well, I do! Why don\\'t we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...\\nCheryl: I\\'d rather not.\\nRoss: Oh, yeah, why not?\\nCheryl: Okay, um, don\\'t take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.\\nMonica: Oh, is everything in the car?\\nPhoebe: Yes. Did you settle the bill?\\nMonica: No. I hate this part.\\nPhoebe: Oh, look what we almost left.\\nMonica: No, that\\'s not mine.\\nPhoebe: Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!\\nMonica: Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we\\'re all cleaned up in the kitchen.\\nMrs. Burkart: Oh, good. Thank you.\\nMonica: Um, and, well there\\'s the.. the the small matter of...\\nMrs. Burkart: Dear?\\nMonica: Just the matter of ...payment?\\nMrs. Burkart:\\nRachel: You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.\\nChandler:  Sure...\\nRachel: And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know... um, Grease?\\nRachel: No....\\nChandler: Rent?\\nRachel: Yes! Rent!\\nChandler: Okay, so when do you want to go?\\nRachel: What? Oh, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t, I\\'m busy.\\nJoey:  Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.\\nChandler: Yes, it is, at Office Max.\\nRachel: What did you get her?\\nChandler: A pen.\\nJoey: It\\'s two gifts in one. It\\'s a pen that\\'s also a clock! Huh?\\nChandler: Huh-huh! You can\\'t give her that.\\nJoey: Why not?\\nChandler: Because she\\'s not eleven! And it\\'s not the seventh night of Hanukkah!\\nRachel: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it\\'s just not something a boyfriend gives?\\nJoey: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she\\'s writing, she turns it over.... \"Whoa! It\\'s time for my date with Joey!\"\\nChandler: All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?\\nJoey: She didn\\'t have a birthday while we were going out.\\nChandler: For three years?\\nJoey:  Look, it\\'s too late, and I got an audition. I can\\'t shop anymore! I...\\nChandler: All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?\\nJoey: Thanks, man. And oh, while you\\'re at it, could you get her a card?\\nChandler: Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?\\nJoey: Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.\\nPhoebe: But Mon, you have to get our money!\\nMonica: Oh, Phoebe, she couldn\\'t stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.\\nPhoebe: I know, it\\'s tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother\\'s funeral was?\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: Pay the caterer! Look, I\\'ve had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It\\'s either, you know, \"that massage wasn\\'t long enough, or, \"I don\\'t recognize any of those songs,\" or, you know, \"these sombreros aren\\'t big enough. Bad little white girl!\"\\nMonica: Okay. So what do you.... you think she\\'s faking?\\nPhoebe: Well, it seems like there weren\\'t any tears \\'til you showed her the bill.\\nMonica: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.\\nMrs. Burkart:  You\\'re a grand ol\\' flag, you\\'re a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....\\nPhoebe: She seems fine now.\\nMrs. Burkart:  ...emblem of the land I love. The home of....\\nJoey: So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?\\nRoss: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nRoss: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it\\'s a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it\\'s a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it\\'s the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.\\nJoey: Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?\\nRoss: What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.\\nJoey: All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.\\nRoss: No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.\\nJoey: What kind of smell?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know. Soap?\\nJoey: All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nJoey: You wanna see her again, right?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nJoey: So you\\'re gonna have to do it in the mess!\\nRoss: Yeah, okay you\\'re right.\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nRoss: I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nRoss: It\\'s, uh... it\\'s endearing, really.\\nJoey: All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink!\\nChandler: Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.\\nRachel: Any luck?\\nChandler: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called \"Invisible things for Kathy.\"  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?\\nRachel: All right, look. Why don\\'t you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.\\nChandler: She\\'s really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don\\'t get to be the one who gives it to her.\\nRachel: Aw, honey, that\\'s so sweet.\\nChandler: Yeah? You don\\'t think it\\'s just pathetic?\\nRachel: Oh! Pathetic!\\nJoey:  Hey! I\\'m meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I\\'ve been looking all over for you!\\nChandler: Where?\\nJoey: Our place, the hall! I...\\nChandler: I got something for her.  It\\'s a book!\\nJoey:  Is it like a book that\\'s also a safe?\\nChandler: No, it\\'s a book that\\'s just a book, okay? It\\'s an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?\\nJoey: You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn\\'t any change from that twenty, was there?\\nChandler: No, it came out to an even twenty.\\nJoey: Wow. That\\'s almost as much as a new book.\\nMrs. Burkart:  Jeepers, creepers, where\\'d you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where\\'d you get those eyes?\\nPhoebe: You didn\\'t get the money, did you?\\nMonica: Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let\\'s just go!\\nPhoebe: No! Hey, we\\'re not leaving until we get paid! I don\\'t know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough!  Hey, widow?\\nMrs. Burkart:  Come on along and listen to...\\nPhoebe: Okay, Widow!\\nMrs. Burkart:  ...the lullabye of...\\nPhoebe: Excuse me. Excuse me!  Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we\\'re paid every penny. \\'Cause you know what, lady? We\\'re part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.\\nMrs. Burkart: All right. I\\'ll get my bag.\\nPhoebe: Good.\\nMonica: I\\'m gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.\\nCheryl: So you want to come inside?\\nRoss:\\nCheryl: I\\'ll be right back.

It\\'s my hamster! It\\'s Mitzi!\\nRoss: Oh my god! I\\'m so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.\\nCheryl:  Oh, thank god, it\\'s not Mitzi. It\\'s just a rat.\\nRachel: I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there\\'s nobody to hug!\\nGunther: Move!\\nRachel: Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!\\nPhoebe: Uh... yay!\\nRachel: Thanks!\\nMonica: Oh, that\\'s great! Congratulations!\\nRachel: Thank you! Hey, how\\'d the catering go?\\nMonica: Oh, it was great!

Oh, and Joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.\\nRachel: Would you stop?!

See, Im not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.\\nRachel: Okay, fine.\\nChandler: You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!\\nJoey: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me!

Yknow\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nPhoebe Sr: I really dont think its a very good idea, Phoebe.\\nPhoebe: Why not?\\nPhoebe Sr: Well, because youd be giving up a baby, and I-I really dontI dont know if theres anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,\\nPhoebe: Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Dont-dont hurt the puppy.\\nPhoebe Sr: No-no-no, the-the puppys yours.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I get a puppy!!\\nPhoebe Sr: Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.\\nPhoebe: Why?\\nPhoebe Sr: I realise I dont have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm,  uhh Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, its very important.\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nPhoebe Sr: I mean, I know what Im talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.

Chandler, this is my job! Im-Im playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!\\nChandler: Well, you can understand, given how we started.\\nKathy: Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face.\\nChandler: Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denying this!\\nKathy: Ill tell you what, Chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up!\\nChandler: Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon!\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: I have the best job in the entire world!

Wait! This isnt take-out!\\nPhoebe:  Well, I hate to eat and run, but\\nMonica: No, wait, please dont go! Ive got porn for you too!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I dont need it.\\nMonica: People are supposed to wanna hang out here!\\nRachel: Why? Honey, what is the big deal?\\nMonica: Im the hostess! Not those guys! Im always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.\\nPhoebe: Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y\\'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?\\nMonica: Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But Im-Im done now. Theyve suffered enough.\\nPhoebe: If you wanted to punish them, you shouldve just made them hang out here!\\nRachel: Yeah, thats true.\\nMonica: All right then, when Im done with this place, its gonna be ten times better than that place!\\nPhoebe: Oh, are we gonna trash that place?\\nChandler: Steps!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!\\nAll: What?!\\nRoss: So you were right?\\nChandler: I confronted her, and she didnt deny it!\\nRoss: Chandler!\\nRachel: Chandler, what did she say?\\nPhoebe: Wait a minute.\\nJoey: Come here.\\nMonica: Are you sure?\\nChandler: Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said!

It doesnt seem desperate?\\nJoey: Oh-ooh, thats the turn-on.\\nPhoebe: He just got a divorce right?\\nRachel: Hmm-mmm.\\nPhoebe: So hes probably really nervous around women, y\\'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.\\nRachel: Yeah but, Ive never asked a guy out before.\\nPhoebe:  Youve never asked a guy out?!!\\nRachel: No. Have you?\\nPhoebe: Thousands of times!! That doesnt make me sound too good does it?\\nRachel: I dont even know how I would go about it.\\nJoey: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \"Hey, how you doin?\"\\nPhoebe: Oh, please!\\nJoey:  Hey, how you doin?\\nRachel: You know what, Im gonna do that, Im gonna call him up, and Im gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  Youve done that a thousand times?\\nPhoebe: Ive never done that.\\nRachel: Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.\\nJoey: Well, you gotta give him something that he cant say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, youre guaranteed hell say yes!\\nRachel: Really?! You think that will work?\\nJoey: Absolutely! And if it doesnt, can I get the extra ticket?\\nJoey: What the heck is that?\\nChandler: Did she call?\\nPhoebe: No, sorry.\\nChandler: All right, maybe I should call her.\\nJoey: No! Forget her, man! You dont need her, you dont need that!\\nRoss: Hes right, what she did was unforgivable.\\nChandler: Well, yeah, but y\\'know, what-what if I was wrong?\\nRoss: How might you be wrong?\\nChandler: Well y\\'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?\\nJoey: Dude, tell me she actually told you this.\\nChandler: She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!\\nRoss: Thats all youre basing this on?\\nChandler: Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.\\nJoey: Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.\\nChandler: Oh my God!!\\nRachel: Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?\\nJoshua: What do you think?\\nRachel: Oh!

I really wish youd call me.\\nChandler: Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yknow I-I think this is a good thing. Y\\'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on.

Yknow I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I dont hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.\\nPhoebe: How? How is your fault?\\nChandler: Because, I-I shouldve called! Yknow if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and they wouldve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!\\nRachel: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.\\nRoss: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break\\nClosing Credits\\nMr. Waltham: Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold.

And the guys from work had a blast. Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah!

My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!\\nChandler: Well, I think it all started when you said, \"Hey Joey, why dont you be my best man.\"\\nRoss:  All right-all right, fine!

They said theyre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.\\nRoss: Okay, well, well call the company that sent her!\\nJoey: I did that too! They wouldnt give me her real name or her number. They said, \"If I bothered them again theyd call the police.\" I said, \"If you talk to the police, you tell them Im missing a ring!\"\\nRoss: So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That theres nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!\\nJoey: Look Ross, I am so-so sorry.

You found a place?\\nEmily: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.\\nRoss: She said what?\\nEmily: She said, \"If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.\"\\nRoss: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isnt right.\\nEmily: I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.\\nRoss: I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?\\nEmily: Dont you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?

Its now or never?\\nRoss: No. Im saying its now.\\nEmily: Or?\\nRoss: Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!\\nEmily: Its not the pants. Its you that is backwards. And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!\\nRoss:\\nCommercial Break\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nRachel:  Hi.\\nPhoebe: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?\\nRachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.\\nPhoebe: Well, I think I can help you get over him.\\nRachel: You can?\\nPhoebe: Yeah.

And youre going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.\\nRachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.\\nPhoebe: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think hes such a great guy. Here.  Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that youre with Ross okay and imagine that youre kissing him. And youre-youre running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross its some kind of grease, itsuck! Hah?\\nRachel: I dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.\\nPhoebe: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, lets try some uh, aversion therapy.\\nRachel: Okay.\\nPhoebe: Okay?\\nRachel: All right.\\nPhoebe: So uh, now look at the picture\\nRachel: Okay.\\nPhoebe: All right, and umm\\nRachel: Ow!\\nPhoebe: Okay, how do you feel now?\\nRachel: Well, I like you less!\\nJoey: Hey.\\nChandler: Hey.\\nJoey: Oh.

Youre even dumber than I am!\\nRoss: Excuse me?\\nMonica: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?\\nRoss: I dont know. A month?\\nMonica: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thats what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.\\nRoss: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.\\nMonica: Sometimes we were.\\nRoss: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?\\nMonica: Okay.\\nRoss: Come on.\\nChandler: That was pretty intense huh?\\nJoey: Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didnt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!\\nChandler:  I hope he did!\\nPhoebe: Hello.\\nJoey:  Hey, Pheebs! Its Joey!\\nPhoebe: Hey, Joey!

No one ever wrote back.\\nChandler: Well y\\'know a lot of those Muppets don\\'t have thumbs.\\nPhoebe: All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.

You\\'ll be answering the phones.\\nJoey: You don\\'t seem to understand.

Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!\\nRachel: Maybe Joey\\'s right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.\\nPhoebe: I will find a selfless good deed! \\'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!\\nChandler:  Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?\\nMonica: Sure!\\nChandler: If you\\'re cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?\\nRachel: Chandler!  Is he?\\nMonica: Well, y\\'know I-I-I think I\\'m gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.\\nChandler: Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you\\'d ever had, I\\'d be going like this.\\nRoss: All right Emily, as much as I love you, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t move to London without Ben.\\nEmily: I understand that would be difficult.\\nRoss: Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can\\'t you just do that?\\nEmily: I don\\'t know, it\\'s just\\nRoss: Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I\\'ve been a-a complete idiot up \\'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.\\nEmily: All right.\\nRoss: All right, did you just say all right?\\nEmily: I did. Now I\\'m the idiot.\\nRoss: Oh, Emily that is, that is so great.

We\\'re gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!\\nEmily: Ross, there\\'s one thing that really scares me still.\\nRoss: Yes, tell me.\\nEmily: Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.\\nRoss: I know. I am, I am so sorry.\\nEmily: And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.\\nRoss: Again, very sorry.\\nEmily: I mean, I can\\'t-I can\\'t be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!\\nRoss: Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.\\nEmily: All right. I\\'ll come to New York and we\\'ll try and make this work.\\nRoss: Oh that is so great! That\\'s\\nEmily:  As long as you don\\'t see Rachel anymore.\\nCommercial Break\\nRoss: So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.\\nChandler: Yes!\\nPhoebe: Ooh-ohh!\\nMonica: Great!\\nRoss: No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.\\nPhoebe: Why?\\nMonica: What?! You can\\'twhat did you tell her?\\nRoss: I told her I\\'d have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I\\'m actually asking you!\\nChandler: Well, you can\\'t just not see Rachel anymore, she\\'s one of your best friends.\\nMonica: Yeah! But, he can\\'t not exactly see Emily, I mean that\\'s his wife.\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nChandler: That\\'s true!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, but you\\'ve known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.\\nChandler: That\\'s true!\\nMonica: No, you cannot.\\nRoss: Thanks for the help, problem solved.\\nMonica:  Hello.\\nJoey:  Hey Mon!\\nMonica: Oh hey Joey! We\\'ve been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?\\nJoey: See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent\\'s office, but I\\'m still on TV and that\\'s good exposure.\\nMonica:  You\\'re not on TV.\\nJoey: Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?\\nChandler: Hey, there he is!

Umm, hey, umm, Joey\\'s gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.\\nMonica: Yeah, so?\\nChandler: Well I just, thought maybe you\\'d wanna book some time with the best you\\'d ever had.\\nMonica: Y\\'know what, champ? I think I\\'ll pass.\\nChandler: Why?\\nMonica: Why?\\nChandler: What\\'s your point?\\nJoey:  PBS telethon.\\nPhoebe:  Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.\\nJoey: What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?\\nPhoebe: Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.\\nJoey: Now, y\\'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.\\nPhoebe:\\nStage Director: Back on in 30 seconds people!\\nJoey: Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?\\nPBS Volunteer: Hey, no way, I\\'m in the shot man.\\nJoey: Come on man! You\\'ve been here all day!\\nPBS Volunteer: Yeah, I-I\\'m taking pledges here, eh?\\nStage Director: We\\'re on in 3, 2,\\nGary Collins: Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you\\'ve been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil,\\nRoss:\\nMonica: A Magic Eight ball?! You can\\'t be serious, you can\\'t make this decision with a toy!\\nPhoebe: Ooh, it\\'s not a toy.\\nRoss: Well, I don\\'t know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I\\'m 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let\\'s hear it! \\'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don\\'t be shy, any suggestion will do.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!\\nMonica: All right, let me see.  Don\\'t count on it. Seems like it works to me.\\nJoey:  PBS Telethon.\\nPhoebe:  Hi Joey.\\nJoey: Hey Pheebs!\\nPhoebe: I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.\\nJoey: $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'m still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who\\'s moms didn\\'t kill themselves, so by supporting them, I\\'m doing a good thing, but I\\'m not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.\\nJoey: And you don\\'t a little good about donating the money?\\nPhoebe: No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.\\nJoey: A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.\\nGary Collins:  Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!\\nPhoebe: Oh, look-look, Joey\\'s on TV! Isn\\'t that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feelOh no!\\nChandler:  Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there\\'s something you gotta know. If I\\'m the best, it\\'s only because you\\'ve made me the best.\\nMonica: Keep talking.\\nChandler: I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn\\'t take long. But when I\\'m with you, and we\\'re together, OHMYGOD.\\nMonica: Really?\\nChandler: Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We\\'re too good! We owe it, to sex!\\nMonica: Well, if we owe it?  Oh my When is Joey gonna be home?\\nChandler: Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.\\nMonica: But, I just cleaned the bathroom.\\nChandler: Yeah, why don\\'t we lose the gloves.\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nChandler: All right, let\\'s show them how it\\'s done.\\nMonica: Okay.\\nMonica: Ow!\\nChandler: Y\\'know that wasn\\'t part of it?\\nMonica: I know!\\nRachel:  Hi! Are you ready? We\\'re gonna be late!\\nRoss: For what?\\nRachel: For Stella! Remember? She\\'s gettin\\' her grove back in like 20 minutes.\\nRoss: Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I\\'m waiting for a call from Emily.\\nRachel: Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don\\'t have to go to London. Yay!\\nRoss: It\\'s not that easy, there\\'s still a lot of relationship stuff.\\nRachel: Like what?\\nRoss: Just stuff. Y\\'know kinda what Emily wants.\\nRachel: Well, why don\\'t you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.\\nRoss: No. No. You-you can\\'t help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.\\nRachel: Well, I-I know you can do that too. I\\'m just, I\\'m just saying if you need somebody to talk to Hi!\\nRoss: Thanks.\\nRachel: Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.

I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.\\nRachel: Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that\\'s the best news I\\'ve heard since Le Poo died!\\nRoss: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.\\nRachel: Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.\\nRoss: What are you doing?\\nRachel: Storming out!\\nRoss: Rachel, this is your apartment.\\nRachel: Yeah, well that\\'s how mad I am!!\\nCommercial Break\\nChandler: Damn Rollos!\\nJoey: Hey, you\\'re back!\\nChandler: Hey.\\nJoey: How was your conference?\\nChandler: It was terrible. I fought with\\nJoey: Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?\\nChandler: Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.\\nMonica:  Hi!\\nJoey: Hey, you\\'re back too!\\nMonica: Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?\\nJoey: Hey, how was your chef thing?\\nMonica: Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don\\'t appreciate really good food.\\nChandler: Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.\\nMonica: Chandler!\\nChandler: Monica.\\nMonica: Okay, I\\'d like to know how much the room was because I\\'d like to pay my half.\\nChandler: Okay, fine, $300.\\nMonica: 300 dollars?!\\nChandler: Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!\\nMonica: Urghh!!\\nJoey:  What are you guys woofing about?\\nMonica: Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!\\nJoey: Nooooo!!! Y\\'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!\\nRoss: You should\\'ve seen the look on her face. I don\\'t want Rachel to hate me! I don\\'t know what to do.\\nJoey: You want my advice?\\nRoss: Yes! Please!\\nJoey: You\\'re not gonna like it.\\nRoss: That\\'s okay.\\nJoey: You got married to fast.\\nRoss: That\\'s not advice!\\nJoey: I told ya.\\nRoss: I\\'m going to the bathroom.\\nJoey: Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn\\'t do it.\\nChandler and Phoebe: Yeah, me either.\\nMonica: Maybe I could do it.\\nRachel:  Hi!\\nJoey: Hi, Rach.\\nChandler: Hi!\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nMonica: Hey.\\nRachel: Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y\\'know, I\\'ve been obsessing about it all day and I\\'d just love not to talk about it. All right?\\nJoey: I-I-I don\\'t know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.\\nRachel: That\\'s not Ross!\\nPhoebe: Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.\\nChandler: Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.\\nRachel: Oh my God, its happening. It\\'s already started. I\\'m Kip.\\nJoey: Hey, you\\'re not Kip!\\nRachel:  Do you even know who Kip is?\\nJoey: Who cares? You\\'re Rachel!  Who\\'s Kip?\\nChandler: Kip, my old roommate, y\\'know we all used to hang out together.\\nJoey: Oh, that poor bastard.\\nRachel: See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn\\'t even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!\\nMonica: You\\'re not gonna be phased out!\\nRachel: Well, of course I am! It\\'s not gonna happen to Ross! He\\'s your brother.  He\\'s your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.\\nPhoebe: Ehh!!\\nRachel: Honey, come on! You live far away! You\\'re not related. You lift right out.\\nChandler:  Hey!\\nJoey: Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.\\nChandler: Yes that was mine.\\nJoey: \\'Cause I figured you\\'d hooked up with some girl and she\\'d left it there.\\nChandler: Yes that would have made more sense.\\nJoey: Y\\'know, I-I don\\'t even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I\\'m just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I\\'ll believe ya.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!\\nRachel: Phoebe?  You gotta come with me!\\nPhoebe: Come where?\\nRachel: Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we\\'ll-we\\'ll start a new group, we\\'re the best ones.\\nPhoebe: Okay, but try and get Joey too.\\nRoss:  Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?\\nPhoebe: Oh, sure!  Forever.\\nRoss: Hi.\\nRachel: Hi. What are you doing here? Isn\\'t this against the rules?\\nRoss: I talked to Monica, look, I\\'m the one who made the choice. I\\'m the one who\\'s making things change, so I should be the one to y\\'know, step back.\\nRachel: Oh, Ross\\nRoss: No, no, it\\'s okay. Really. They\\'re plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?\\nRachel: No, it\\'s not better. I still don\\'t get to see you.\\nRoss: Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?\\nRachel: Well, for starters I would\\'ve said the right name at my wedding!\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe this is happening.\\nRachel: I know.\\nRoss: I am so sorry.\\nRachel: I know that too.\\nJoey:  Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.\\nChandler:  Hey!\\nMonica: Hi.\\nChandler: I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?\\nMonica: Yeah, it did.\\nChandler: So, I guess this is over.\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: Well, y\\'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.\\nMonica: Why, exactly?\\nChandler: Because of the weekend, we had a fight.\\nMonica: Chandler that\\'s crazy! If you give up every time you\\'d have a fight with someone you\\'d never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!\\nChandler: So, this isn\\'t over?\\nMonica:  You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It\\'s nothing to freak out about.\\nChandler: Really? Okay. Great!\\nMonica: Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!\\nChandler:  We\\'re in a relationship?\\nMonica: I\\'m afraid so.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.\\nMonica: Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.\\nMonica: Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.\\nRachel: Yeah, it\\'s in there.\\nJoey:  Oh! Ohh! Oh!!\\nChandler: Joey, can I talk to you for a second?\\nJoey: Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!\\nJoey: Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!\\nChandler: Yes. Yes.\\nJoey:  And-and you?!\\nMonica: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!\\nJoey: How?! When?!\\nChandler: It happened in London.\\nJoey: IN LONDON!!!\\nChandler: The reason we didn\\'t tell anyone was because we didn\\'t want to make a big deal out of it.\\nJoey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!\\nChandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can\\'t!\\nMonica: Please? Please?! We just don\\'t want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won\\'t tell.\\nJoey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it\\'s great, but\\nMonica: I know, it\\'s great!\\nJoey: Aww, I don\\'t want to see that!\\nPhoebe: We\\'re so stupid! Do you know what\\'s going on in there? They\\'re trying to take Joey!\\nEnding Credits\\nPhoebe: The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, \"Hi, Phoebe!\"\\nMonica: Oh that\\'s cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y\\'know, it doesn\\'t count.\\nPhoebe: Count for what?\\nMonica: Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.\\nJoey: I guess I\\'m done.\\nChandler: Fun\\'s over!\\nMonica: Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it\\'s still fun and it means something!\\nRachel: Uh-huh!\\nJoey: I think I\\'m gonna take-off.\\nMonica: Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!\\nEnd\\n======== 05-06\\nWritten by: Alexa Junge Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\nJoey:  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you\\'re living under my roof!\\nMonica: What?!\\nJoey: Look, just because I know about you two, doesn\\'t mean I like looking at it.\\nChandler: Aren\\'t you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?\\nJoey: Well, I\\'m sorry if I\\'m not a middle-aged black woman!  And I\\'m also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don\\'t know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there\\'s nothing to know about.\\nChandler and Monica: Okay.\\nMonica: Sorry.\\nChandler: Sorry.\\nJoey:  I can hear that!\\nMonica:  Rachel\\'s at work.\\nJoey: I can still hear you!\\nOpening Credits\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Hello!\\nMonica: Hey, what\\'s that?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn\\'t even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.\\nPhoebe: Eeeee-\\nJoey: Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn\\'t she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!\\nChandler: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn\\'t happen, I made that up!\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nGunther: Oh, Ross? Ross! You can\\'t put up flyers in here.\\nRoss: How come? Everybody else does.\\nGunther: You can\\'t.\\nMonica: What is that?\\nRoss: Oh, umm, I\\'m just getting rid of a couple of things.\\nMonica:  This is all of your things.\\nRoss: Yes, yes it is! No, but it\\'s good it\\'sEmily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that\\'s just ours, together. Y\\'know brand new.\\nMonica: So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.\\nRoss: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.\\nGunther: I\\'ll take it all.\\nJoey: Hey, Ross, you\\'re okay with that?\\nRoss: Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I\\'m sure everything will be fine.\\nChandler: Okay, but don\\'t you think this is a little extreme?\\nRoss: After what I did? Can you blame her?\\nPhoebe: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie\\'s husband said someone else\\'s name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.\\nJoey:  What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross\\'s furniture has got Rachel coodies?\\nMonica: Now calm down Joey.\\nJoey: No! Everything\\'s gettin\\' all messed up, y\\'know? Emily won\\'t let Ross see Rachel, we\\'re not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I hate this. Everything\\'s changing.\\nChandler: Yeah I know, we\\'re losing Ross, Joey said hence\\nMonica: Look, I\\'m not happy about this either, but y\\'know if-if Ross says he\\'s happy then we\\'re just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?\\nJoey: No! But y\\'know, I\\'m an actor, I\\'ll act cool.\\nRachel: Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?\\nMonica: Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.\\nRachel: I want the little round waffles.\\nMonica: All right.  Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?\\nRachel: Okay, y\\'know what? I\\'ll-I\\'ll have toast!\\nRachel: Arghhhh!!!!!!\\nMonica: Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do about this coat.\\nJoey: I\\'ll take it!\\nPhoebe: That might work!\\nJoey: Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?\\nChandler: You\\'re on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.\\nRoss:\\nJoey: What\\'s the matter Ross?\\nRoss: Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I\\'m moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!\\nPhoebe: Why?\\nRoss: Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it\\'s got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.\\nJoey: That\\'s way uptown! That\\'s like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!\\nChandler: So you\\'re really okay with this?\\nRoss: Yes! Yes! I mean it\\'s-it\\'s kinda far from work, but uh, y\\'know, I\\'ll get so much done on the commute. I-I\\'ve been given the gift of time!\\nChandler: Now that\\'s so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.\\nJoey: Now he\\'s movin\\'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He\\'s not even here!!!\\nRachel: You guys! You guys!\\nMonica: We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!\\nRachel: It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!\\nMonica: And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!\\nRachel:  Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!\\nJoey: Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nJoey: Yeah, you fogged Danny.\\nRachel: Please! We did not fog Danny! Who\\'s Danny?\\nJoey: Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.\\nMonica: Oh he\\'s nice. He\\'s nice! Y\\'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!\\nDanny: Yeah?\\nRachel: Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.\\nMonica: We\\'re-we\\'re really sorry we fogged you.\\nDanny: Okay.\\nRachel: Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn\\'t mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.\\nDanny: Okay.\\nDanny: Yesss?\\nRachel: Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don\\'t think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn\\'t really seem like you mean it.\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nDanny: O-kay!\\nMonica: Wow! That guy is so rude!\\nRachel: Really! What is with that guy? I mean you\\'d forgive me if I fogged you.\\nMonica: Well you did a little bit.\\nRachel: Oh my God, honey, I\\'m so sorry!\\nMonica: I totally forgive you!\\nRachel: Really?\\nMonica: Yes!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nPhoebe: So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?\\nMonica: Crematorium Chris? Sure!\\nPhoebe: He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y\\'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.\\nRachel: Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!\\nMonica: Don\\'t get too attached, she\\'s having it cremated.\\nRachel: What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you\\'re quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!\\nPhoebe: This is fashion?!  \\'Cause I do.\\nRoss:\\nChandler: Okay, what is in here? Rocks?\\nRoss: No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.\\nChandler: So, rocks.\\nRoss: I\\'m really gonna miss this apartment. Y\\'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.\\nJoey: Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?\\nRoss: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn\\'t have to move.\\nJoey: Uhh, are you saying that you\\'re not entirely happy about this?\\nRoss: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice\\nJoey: You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!\\nRoss: Why?\\nJoey: It\\'s not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he\\'s not entirely happy.\\nRoss: What\\'s going on?\\nJoey: We all hate Emily!\\nPhoebe: Nooo!!\\nMonica: No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you\\'re having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nChandler: Look, we just think that maybe she\\'s being a little unreasonable.\\nJoey: Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!\\nRoss: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it\\'s about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it\\'s not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It\\'s real life, okay? It\\'s what grown-ups do!\\nPhoebe: I think he\\'s right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: God, I feel so guilty about Ross.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I know.\\nJoey: I kinda feel like it\\'s my fault.\\nChandler: Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would\\'ve happened.\\nJoey: Well, I\\'m keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!\\nChandler: Well, I think it\\'s very brave what you said.\\nPhoebe: All right, I can\\'t sit here anymore. I have to walk places.\\nChandler: Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?\\nPhoebe: Well, I\\'ve been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, Iit\\'s the best thing I\\'ve ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!  Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nDanny: So you like the short hair better.\\nRachel: What? YetiI mean Danny?\\nDanny: I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.\\nRachel: Oh. Listen, I\\'m so sorry. I would, I would\\'ve never fogged you if y\\'know if you hadn\\'t looked so. Y\\'know.\\nDanny: Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.\\nRachel:  What?\\nDanny: That\\'s cool. Cool.\\nRachel: What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don\\'t even know me!\\nDanny: Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack\\'s catalog.\\nRachel: So from that you think you\\'ve got me all figured out? Well, you don\\'t! Y\\'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!\\nDanny: Do you?\\nRachel: Well, y\\'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.\\nDanny: Okay.\\nRachel: And stop saying that! I hate that!\\nDanny: Okay!\\nRachel: Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can\\'t even open up your mind for a second to see if you\\'re wrong! What does that say about you?\\nDanny: The pizza-place across the street any good?\\nRachel: What?!\\nDanny: I\\'m hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there\\'s more.\\nRachel: Okay. Okay.\\nDanny: Stop saying that. I hate that.\\nChandler: Uh, Ross?\\nPhoebe: Are you still mad at us?\\nRoss: Yep.\\nPhoebe: Oh good! Because we have an \"I\\'m sorry\" song.\\nRoss: Y\\'know what? I\\'m really not in the mood.\\nJoey: Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you\\'re going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.\\nChandler: Yeah, we are so sorry.\\nPhoebe:\\nJoey: Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.\\nMonica: Whatever you decide, whatever you do.\\nPhoebe: Okay, now you\\'re just taking lines right out of the song!\\nRoss: Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.\\nPhoebe: Yes! Exactly! And that\\'s why\\nMonica: Why don\\'t you come over tonight? And I\\'ll make you favorite dinner.\\nRoss: Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?\\nPhoebe: Okay, let\\'s get some perspective people; it\\'s not like I\\'m wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!\\nJoey: Hey, y\\'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.\\nRoss: You do, huh?\\nJoey: Yeah you see umm, well, I\\'m an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y\\'know? See what I\\'m saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y\\'know what I mean? It\\'s tough!

Where have you been?\\nRachel: Oh, I went to have pizza.

Hold on.\\nPhoebe: Hi Emily!\\nChandler: Hi!\\nEmily: Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?\\nJoey: Well uh, I don\\'t know about who\\'s here, but I can tell you for damn sure who\\'s not here and that\\'s Rachel!!\\nEmily:  Well, I should hope not.

I thought I\\'d made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!\\nRoss:  Look Emily, I\\'m just having dinner with my friends, okay?\\nEmily: You obviously can\\'t keep away from her.\\nRoss: Emily that\\'s ridiculous. Look, I\\'m-I\\'m moving for you, I\\'m cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you\\'ll see you\\'re the only person I want to be with.\\nEmily: I\\'ll feel better when I\\'m there, and I can know where you are all the time.\\nRoss: Well, you can\\'t know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don\\'t trust me.\\nEmily: You\\'re right.\\nRoss: So, can you trust me?\\nEmily: No.\\nJoey: I think it\\'s going okay. Looks like he\\'s smiling.\\nMonica: How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!\\nJoey: You can totally tell!

He\\'s not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.\\nMonica: And you\\'re not gonna do that.\\nRachel: That\\'s right! \\'Cause that would give him the control! So now he\\'s all ooh, coming up with this whole I\\'ve got a party thing y\\'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn\\'t it?\\nMonica: So-so there is no party.\\nRachel: No, there\\'s a party. There\\'s a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?\\nMonica: I think so. Se, he-he\\'s not inviting you to his party because he likes you.\\nRachel: Exactly.\\nJoey: Ross?\\nRoss:  Hey roomies!\\nChandler: Love what you\\'ve done with the place.\\nRoss: Oh, yeah I know, I know, it\\'s a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.\\nJoey: Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you\\'re gonna be here for a while, why don\\'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.\\nChandler: Oh yeah!\\nRoss: Oh, I uh, hope you don\\'t mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little.

Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies  have been.\\nPhoebe:  You are just nonstop!\\nLarry:  We\\'re outta here!\\nPhoebe: Why?!\\nLarry: Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I\\'m shutting this place down!\\nPhoebe:  You have the power to do that?\\nLarry: This does.\\nPhoebe:  Shut it down.\\nJoey: Hey.\\nChandler: What are you doing?\\nJoey: Nothing.\\nChandler: You built a fort didn\\'t ya?\\nJoey:  Kinda.\\nChandler:\\nJoey: Dude, you should\\'ve gone out once and a while.\\nChandler: I hate this thing!\\nJoey: Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don\\'t you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!\\nRachel: Oh, hi Danny.\\nDanny: Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.\\nMonica: Oh, thanks! We\\'ll try to stop by.\\nRachel: Uh, actually, I think I\\'m gonna be busy.\\nMonica: You are?\\nRachel: Yeah!

You-you sail?\\nRachel: No-no, but I support it.\\nDanny: Okay,  hope I see you tomorrow night.\\nMonica: Okay.\\nDanny: Take care.\\nRachel: Okay.  Walked right into that one didn\\'t he?\\nMonica: What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!\\nRachel: Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, \"No!\" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.\\nMonica: Great. So the ball is in his court?\\nRachel: Ball? There is no ball.\\nRoss:\\nJoey: Sorry.\\nJoey: Ahhhhhhhhhh\\nChandler:  Hello children!\\nJoey: Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?\\nChandler: Okay.\\nJoey: No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! \\'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!\\nJoey: All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?\\nChandler: Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?\\nJoey: No, the quiet down thing!\\nChandler: You mean this.\\nJoey: Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don\\'t know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?\\nChandler:  All right look, y\\'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!\\nJoey: All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let\\'s have a game.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nChandler: No-no-no-no!\\nJoey: YES!!\\nRoss:\\nChandler: Okay, so he\\'s out of here.\\nJoey: Um-hmm.\\nCommercial Break\\nJoey:  Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nJoey: You guys got anything to eat?

What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!\\nMonica: The fake kind!\\nDanny: Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?\\nMonica: We have a ladle.\\nDanny: Thanks, see you at the party.\\nMonica: Okay, great!\\nPhoebe: Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say?

I mean after all, we all are using it.\\nChandler: Let\\'s go quicker.\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nRoss: Oh my God!\\nChandler: Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that\\'s great! Y\\'know so you can cook while in the tub.\\nJoey: Somebody was using his head. Hey, let\\'s check out the rest of the place.\\nRoss: I think this is it. I don\\'t know, maybe we should keep looking.\\nJoey: But hey, Ross, this place is available now!\\nChandler: Yeah, you don\\'t want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nRoss:  So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?\\nJoey: Oh, it\\'s perfect!\\nRoss:  How about you?\\nChandler: It\\'s a kitchen slash bathroom.\\nRoss: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I\\'ll uh, I\\'ll go downstairs and fill out an application.\\nChandler: We are bad people.\\nJoey: He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?\\nLarry:  Hey, ready for dinner?\\nPhoebe: Ooh, absolutely!\\nLarry: Great!

Okay, let\\'s go!\\nLarry: Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?\\nGunther: But then I\\'d have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.\\nLarry: Oh, so you\\'re saying you\\'d choose convenience over health?!\\nPhoebe: Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can\\'t you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y\\'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it\\'s like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?\\nLarry: Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.\\nPhoebe: Thank you.  Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.\\nJoey: Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!\\nChandler: Yes that was a nice place!\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nChandler: Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nChandler: What are we gonna do?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know. Maybe pizza?\\nChandler: About Ross!\\nJoey: Oh! Oh!\\nJoey: Hello!  Ross is the greatest guy you\\'ll ever meet!

He\\'s right there!\\nMonica: Just go over and say hi.\\nRachel: No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I\\'m coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don\\'t be sexy.\\nMonica: Hey, Danny!\\nDanny: Hey! What\\'s going on?\\nMonica:\\nDanny: Salad.\\nMonica: Ooooh!\\nDanny: Bread. Aren\\'t you a chef?\\nMonica:  Oh.\\nDanny: Hey!

I think you killed us.\\nRoss: I couldn\\'t possibly eat another bite.\\nJoey: I need something sweet.\\nPhoebe: Does anyone wanna watch TV?\\nAll: Yeah, sure.\\nPhoebe: Monica your remote doesn\\'t work.\\nMonica: Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.\\nPhoebe: Oh. Aw, forget it.\\nRachel: Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they\\'re thankful for.\\nJoey: Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we\\'ve been having.\\nMonica: That\\'s very nice.\\nChandler: That\\'s sweet, Joey.\\nJoey: Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick\\'s skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I\\'m also thankful for thongs.\\nOpening Credits\\nJoey: I mean, it\\'s not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it\\'s amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?\\nChandler: Are you aware that you\\'re still talking?\\nMonica: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?\\nRoss: Huh, I don\\'t know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.\\nPhoebe: Wow! See, and I didn\\'t think you\\'d be able to come up with anything.\\nRoss: I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.\\nChandler: No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can\\'t just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.\\nRachel: Oh, you\\'re not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?\\nRoss: Oh God, no.\\nJoey: Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn\\'t be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!\\nChandler: It\\'s a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.\\nThanksgiving 1978\\nMrs. Bing: Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn\\'t mean we don\\'t love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.\\nThe Housekeeper: More turkey Mr. Chandler?\\nPresent Day\\nRoss: You\\'re right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know about that. I\\'ve got one that\\'s worse.\\nChandler: Really? Worse than, \"More turkey Mr. Chandler?\"\\nPhoebe: Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine\\'s worse!\\nThanksgiving 1862\\nPast Life Phoebe: More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying Oh no.\\nPresent Day\\nRoss: In this life, Phoebe.\\nPhoebe: Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler\\'s is worse.\\nJoey: Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don\\'t have any past life memories.\\nPhoebe: Of course you don\\'t sweetie. You\\'re brand new.\\nRachel: I know Monica\\'s worst Thanksgiving.\\nMonica: Oh, let\\'s not tell this story.\\nAll: Oh, come on!\\nPhoebe: Oh no, I know! I know! It\\'s the one where Joey got Monica\\'s turkey stuck on his head!\\nRachel: What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!\\nJoey: Hey, it\\'s not like it sounds.\\nChandler: It\\'s exactly like it sounds.\\nThanksgiving 1992\\nJoey:  Hello?\\nPhoebe:  Hello?\\nJoey: Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Joey? What\\'s going on?\\nJoey: Look.\\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\\nJoey: I know! It\\'s stuck!!!\\nPhoebe:  Easy. Step. How did it get on?\\nJoey: I put it on to scare Chandler!\\nPhoebe: Oh my God! Monica\\'s gonna totally freak out!\\nJoey: Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.\\nPhoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.\\nMonica:  Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey, did you get the turkey bastedOh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?\\nJoey: It\\'s Joey.\\nMonica: What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?\\nPhoebe: No, it\\'s not supposed to be funny, it\\'s supposed to be scary.\\nMonica: Well, get it off now!\\nJoey: I can\\'t! It-it\\'s stuck!\\nMonica: Well, I don\\'t care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent\\'s house and they\\'re not gonna eat it off your head!\\nPhoebe: All right, hold on! Okay, let\\'s just all think.\\nMonica: Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I\\'m gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.  Joey? Now is not the time!\\nJoey: Sorry! Sorry.\\nMonica: Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!\\nChandler: Arghhhhhh!!\\nJoey:  It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!\\nChandler: I\\'m over here big guy.\\nJoey:  I scared you!\\nPresent Day\\nChandler:  You did look like an idiot.\\nJoey: Hey, I wasn\\'t the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, \"Butternut squash?\" And it came out, \"Squatternut buash?\"\\nRoss: Yeah that\\'s the same.\\nMonica: That\\'s it. That\\'s my worse Thanksgiving.\\nPhoebe: Oh wait! That can\\'t be the one Rachel\\'s talking about. She didn\\'t even know that happened. So which one was it?\\nAll: Which one?\\nMonica: Umm, I-I really don\\'t want to tell this story.\\nChandler: Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y\\'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.\\nMonica: Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!\\nThanksgiving 1987\\nMrs. Geller: Monica!

Did you like the macaroni and cheese?\\nChandler: Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.\\nFat Monica: Okay!\\nBig Nosed Rachel: Guess what?!

And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!\\nRoss: So Im thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y\\'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.\\nChandler: Emotional Knapsack?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nChandler: Right on! Oh!

Is there, is there something on my dress?\\nChandler: You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!\\nRoss: Dude!\\nChandler: Sorry!\\nMrs. Geller: Yes, yes Monica is thin. It\\'s wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross\\'s new girlfriend.\\nRoss: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she\\'s really pretty. And smart. And uh, she\\'s-she\\'s on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!\\nMonica: So Chandler, I guess I\\'ll see you at dinner.\\nMr. Geller: Dude!\\nChandler: Sorry.\\nRachel:  Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome!

Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y\\'know I still don\\'t feel like I got him back, y\\'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I\\'m going to point at him and laugh!\\nRachel: Okay, that we may be able to do.\\nMonica: How?\\nRachel: Well guys tend to get naked before they\\'re gonna have sex.\\nMonica: What?! I mean, I didn\\'t work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!\\nRachel: Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one\\'s gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you\\'re not actually gonna have sex with him! You\\'re just gonna make him think that you are.\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nMonica: And when he\\'s naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!\\nRachel: Then, you will definitely get him back!\\nMonica: Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?\\nRachel: Okay, oh, here\\'s what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.\\nMonica: What do you mean?\\nRachel: Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!  Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.\\nMonica:  I can do that!\\nRachel: Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he\\'s coming. He\\'s coming.\\nChandler: Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.\\nMonica: Umm, I\\'d love too!  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nMonica: Boy, I love carrots! Oh!\\nChandler: Are you all right?\\nMonica: Oh yeah, of course. I\\'m fine it\\'s just that\\nThe Doctor: What do we got here?\\nThe Paramedic: Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.\\nRoss: Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!\\nThe Doctor: It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.\\nMr. Geller: Of course it did. They\\'re made of wicker.\\nThe Doctor: Did you bring the toe?\\nMonica: Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!\\nThe Doctor:\\nMonica: What?! What is it?\\nThe Doctor: You brought a carrot.\\nChandler: What?\\nThe Doctor: This isn\\'t your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.\\nRachel: You brought a carrot?!\\nMrs. Geller: Oh my God! There\\'s a toe in my kitchen.\\nMonica: God, I\\'m sorry! I\\'ll go back and get it!\\nThe Doctor: It\\'s too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.\\nChandler: Without my toe?! I need my toe!\\nMonica: Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!\\nMr. Geller: Oh, I\\'m not falling for that one!\\nPresent Day\\nChandler: That\\'s why I lost my toe?!

It\\'s just that, we don\\'t want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it\\'s going really well is because it\\'s a secret.\\nChandler: I know it sounds really weird, but we\\'re just so bad at relationships.\\nMonica: We are! Help us!\\nChandler: Help!\\nJoey: All right! But,  you do it with me once.\\nMonica: Joey!\\nJoey: Didn\\'t think so.\\nOpening Credits\\nMonica: Hey, Phoebe!\\nChandler: Hi, Pheebs!\\nRachel: Hey, Pheebs!\\nJoey: Hey, Pheebs!\\nRachel: What are you reading?\\nPhoebe: Umm, Wethering Heights.

That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!\\nMonica: Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but\\nRoss:  That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can\\'t believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.\\nChandler:  Knock-knock. Who\\'s there? Ross Geller\\'s lunch. Ross Geller\\'s lunch, who?

Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff\\'s character. I totally get symbolism.\\nThe Teacher: How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let\\'s see here , Rachel Green?\\nRachel: Umm, well I would have to say that it\\'s a, it\\'s tragic love story.\\nThe Teacher: Well, that\\'s sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?\\nRachel: Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff\\'s character.\\nThe Teacher: Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here\\nPhoebe:  You completely stole my answer!\\nRachel: Well, honey that was pretty obvious.\\nPhoebe: Well how would you know?! You didn\\'t even read it!\\nThe Teacher: What do you think? You in the blue shirt.\\nPhoebe: I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.\\nThe Teacher: Would ya care to venture one?\\nPhoebe: Would you care to venture one?\\nThe Teacher: Are you just repeating what I\\'m saying?\\nPhoebe: Are you just repeating what I\\'m saying?\\nThe Teacher: All right, let\\'s move on.\\nPhoebe: Okay then.\\nPhoebe: Yeah but why didn\\'t you just say that you didn\\'t read the book?!\\nRachel: Be-because I didn\\'t want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!\\nRoss:  Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nRoss: Phoebe! You\\'re note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.\\nMonica: Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.\\nRoss: That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I\\'m telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.

The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!\\nMonica: We\\'re so sorry.\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nJoey: Well, I\\'m telling everyone about you! That\\'s the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn\\'t make me look like a pig!\\nChandler: No-no, wait! There\\'s got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.\\nJoey: Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?\\nChandler: OhI don\\'t know.\\nJoey: Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!\\nMonica: Okay, just wait, please. I promise we\\'ll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.\\nJoey: All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good.  Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!\\nDr. Leedbetter: Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?\\nRoss: Yeah, of course, Donald.\\nDr. Leedbetter: We\\'ve been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.\\nRoss: What?!\\nDr. Leedbetter: Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.\\nRoss:  Yeah.\\nDr. Leedbetter: We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.\\nRoss: Oh no, you-you don\\'t understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.\\nDr. Leedbetter:  A sandwich?\\nRoss: Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here\\nDr. Leedbetter:  Oh, you know what?\\nRoss: What?\\nDr. Leedbetter: I-I\\'m sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.\\nRoss: You ate my sandwich?\\nDr. Leedbetter: It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.\\nRoss:  Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?\\nDr. Leedbetter: No.\\nRoss: Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?\\nDr. Leedbetter: There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.\\nRoss:  That said it was my sandwich?!\\nDr. Leedbetter: Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.\\nRoss:  What?\\nDr. Leedbetter: Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.\\nRoss: You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!\\nRoss:  MY SANDWICH?!!!\\nRoss: MY SANDWICH!!!!!!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nPhoebe: Hi!\\nRachel:  So umm, what\\'s this book about?\\nPhoebe: You didn\\'t read this one either?!\\nRachel: Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.\\nPhoebe: What?\\nRachel: Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.\\nPhoebe: No! You should\\'ve read it yourself!\\nRachel: Come on Phoebe! Dont be such a goodie-goodie!\\nPhoebe: Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you\\'d think she\\'s a woman, but she\\'s not. She\\'s a cyborg.\\nRachel: A cyborg?! Isn\\'t that like a robot?!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.\\nThe Teacher:  Sorry I\\'m late. Let\\'s get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?\\nPhoebe: Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.\\nThe Teacher: Well, go ahead Rachel.\\nRachel: Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.\\nThe Teacher: If you\\'re talking about feminism, I think you\\'re right.\\nRachel: Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.\\nChandler: Hey.\\nMonica: Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn\\'t work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.\\nChandler:  You\\'re naked in this picture!\\nMonica: I know.\\nChandler: Ross?\\nRoss:  Monica!\\nMonica: Ross, are you okay?\\nRoss: I\\'m fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.\\nMonica: Why?!\\nRoss: On account of my rage.\\nChandler: Which I may say, right now, is out of control.\\nRoss: He gave me a pill for it.\\nMonica: A pill?\\nRoss: Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.\\nMonica: Wait a minute, they\\'re making you take time off work?\\nChandler: And you\\'re okay with that?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know. It\\'s going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don\\'t care about my sandwich.\\nRachel:  Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can\\'t believe you let me go on and on like that!\\nPhoebe:  I\\'m sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.\\nRachel: That was not funny!\\nPhoebe: Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren\\'t taking the class seriously.\\nRachel: Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y\\'know, I thought it would be fun!\\nPhoebe: Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y\\'know I also wanted to learn. Y\\'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.\\nRachel: Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y\\'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?\\nMonica:  I know! I know! I know!\\nThe Teacher: Monica, you asked the question.\\nRachel:  Oh my God! That\\'s Monica!!\\nJoey: Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!\\nRachel: You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!\\nRoss:  What\\'s going on?\\nRachel: Joey has got a secret peephole!\\nChandler:\\nRachel: Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!\\nRachel: Look!\\nRoss:\\nMonica:  Give me that!\\nPhoebe: All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let\\'s give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he\\'s such a big pervert!\\nJoey: No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It\\'s just I just Kinda\\nChandler: All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.\\nJoey: Thank you!\\nChandler: Joey\\'s a sex addict.\\nJoey: What?!!  No I\\'m not!!\\nMonica: It\\'s okay! It\\'s good! It\\'s good. It\\'s a disease!\\nJoey: No! No! I am not a sex addict!\\nMonica: Yes you are! That\\'s the only way to explain all this stuff!\\nJoey: No it isn\\'t! No, it\\'s not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!\\nRachel: Well, what is the truth?\\nRoss: Yeah, what\\'s going on?\\nPhoebe: What\\'s going on?\\nJoey:  I slept with Monica.\\nChandler: Well let\\'s.let\\'s see what everybody thinks of that?\\nMonica: Oh no!\\nRoss: You slept with my sister?\\nJoey: Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.\\nRoss: This is not good for my rage.\\nRachel: Monica, is this true?\\nJoey: Of course it\\'s true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that\\'s been going on?\\nMonica: Yes it\\'s true.\\nRachel: Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?\\nJoey: Ahhoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?\\nMonica: I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.\\nRoss: My God Monica!!\\nChandler: Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you\\'re not just a sex addict?\\nJoey: No! If anyone\\'s a sex addict here, it\\'s Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!\\nPhoebe: So that\\'s why she gave you a naked picture of herself.\\nJoey: That makes sense!\\nRachel: And the video camera?\\nJoey: Uhh, Monica?\\nMonica: I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.\\nJoey: But sadly I could not be enticed.\\nRoss: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey\\'s underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!\\nMonica: I\\'m Monica. I\\'m disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.\\nJoey: Well, I think we\\'ve all learned something about who\\'s disgusting and who\\'s not. Eh? All right, now, I\\'m going to get back to my bucket. I\\'m only eating the skin, so the chicken\\'s up for grabs.\\nEnding Credits\\nPhoebe: I really thought you making a good point. I mean y\\'know, until you got cut off.\\nA Female Student: Yeah, what\\'s up with that girl Monica?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know! I didn\\'t come with her!\\nMonica:  All right everybody!

Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he\\'ll get some work done.\\nRoss: I think he\\'s been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.\\nJoey: Dude, if you think Fireball\\'s relaxing, you\\'ve obviously have never played.\\nChandler: The only reason you\\'re doing this to Joey is because you\\'re bored. Okay, it\\'s not his fault that you\\'re unemployed.\\nRoss: I am not unemployed. I\\'m on sabbatical!\\nJoey: Come on look guys, don\\'t fight.\\nRoss: And the reason I\\'m doing this is because I am Joey\\'s friend. And if you were a good friend, you\\'d be doing the same thing.\\nChandler: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?\\nRoss: If it does? Then you\\'re an amazing friend of mine.\\nJoey: Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh?

I thought we said seven?\\nRachel: Yeah uh, y\\'know what uh, let\\'s skip it.\\nDanny: What?! Why?!\\nRachel: Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and\\nDanny: Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I\\'m close with my sister?\\nRachel: Well, okay, look. I don\\'t know, listen, I don\\'t know what\\'s going on here but let\\'s\\nDanny: Do-do you, do you have brothers?\\nRachel: No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.\\nDanny: Are you close with them?\\nRachel: No-no, they\\'re not very nice people.\\nDanny: Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay?

But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!\\nMonica: My turn? What-what are you talking about?\\nRachel: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.\\nMonica: What?!\\nRachel: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, \"I\\'ll just tell Rachel that I\\'m doing laundry for a couple of hours.\" And he said, \"Laundry? Is that my new nickname?\" And you said, \"No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.\"\\nMonica: Well. Sounds like you\\'re writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow!

Hey-hey that\\'s not a Nutter-Butter, that\\'s just an old Wonton!\\nJoey: Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.\\nPhoebe: Ohh, tough call.\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nDoug: But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.\\nKara: So how do you kids like your coffee?\\nMonica: Oh, none for me. Thanks.\\nChandler: Just a little bit of sugar.\\nDoug: Well, maybe I\\'ll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?\\nMonica:  How does that laugh not give you a headache?\\nChandler: Oh, you get used to it.\\nMonica: Y\\'know, I-I-I don\\'t think that I can. So if you don\\'t mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.\\nChandler: So I laugh at my boss\\'s jokes, what\\'s the big deal?\\nMonica: I\\'d rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.\\nChandler: Oh.\\nDoug:  Did you hear what I said Bing?\\nChandler: What?\\nDoug: The joke Bing. What\\'s the matter with you?\\nChandler: Well, I-I just didn\\'t think it was funny sir.\\nDoug: Excuse me?\\nChandler: Well, I just\\nMonica:  Honey, I just don\\'t think that you understood the joke.\\nChandler: Really?\\nMonica: Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don\\'t think you got it. You see Kara\\'s coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically.

What you\\'re-you\\'re not mad?\\nChandler: Why would I be mad?\\nRoss: Well, because y\\'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don\\'t uh, you don\\'t fool around with your uh, friend\\'s ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they\\'re related to.\\nChandler:  I am mad! But you know what I\\'m gonna do? I\\'m gonna forgive you! Because that\\'s what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.\\nRoss: Okay.\\nChandler: I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!\\nRoss: All right.\\nChandler: And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can\\'t remember that, I think we should write it downlet\\'s write it down!\\nEnd\\n======== 05-13\\nTeleplay by: Seth Kirkland Story by: Michael Curtis Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe we\\'ve never done this before!

And the one person I want to the most.\\nChandler: What\\'s going on?\\nPhoebe: I think it\\'s just y\\'know that I haven\\'t been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you\\'re looking for something and you just dont even see that it\\'s right there in front of you sipping coffeeOh no, have I said to much? Well it\\'s just something to think about. I know I will.\\nMonica: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?\\nChandler: Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.\\nMonica: Okay, now you\\'re even cuter!!\\nChandler: Y\\'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.\\nMonica: What are you talking about?\\nChandler: I\\'m telling you I think Phoebe thinks I\\'m foxy.\\nMonica: That\\'s not possible!\\nChandler: Ow!\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry it\\'s just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.\\nChandler: Oh, y\\'know I-I can\\'t hear that enough.\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.\\nChandler: No, I didn\\'t misunderstand, okay?

Thanks!\\nMonica: I mean I-I don\\'t I think I have enough quarters.\\nPhoebe: I have quarters!\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nRachel: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?\\nRoss: Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he\\'s already had like a hundred applicants.\\nRachel: Oh.\\nRoss: No-no, I got the edge. I know it\\'s not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to\\ntip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window.\\nMonica: Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?\\nRoss: No.\\nChandler: That new mountain bike?\\nRoss: No.\\nMonica: Well what did you send?\\nRoss: A basket of mini-muffins.\\nPhoebe: But there\\'s a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?\\nRoss: The small one.\\nRachel: What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?\\nRoss: Well yeah!

She knows about us!\\nChandler: Are you serious?\\nMonica: Phoebe knows and she\\'s just trying to freak us out! That\\'s the only explanation for it!\\nChandler:  Okay but what about y\\'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!\\nCommercial Break\\nChandler:  Joey!\\nJoey: Yeah?\\nChandler: Phoebe knows about us!\\nJoey: Well I didn\\'t tell them!\\nMonica: Them?!

But hey, it\\'s over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!\\nMonica: Unless\\nJoey: No! Not unless! Look this must end now!\\nMonica: Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don\\'t know that we know that they know! So\\nChandler: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!\\nRoss: Noooo.\\nRachel: Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, why don\\'t you just find another apartment?\\nRoss: Look I\\'ve already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!\\nRachel: Y\\'know what you should do?\\nRoss: Huh?\\nRachel: You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.\\nJoey: I\\'m listening.\\nRachel:  See?\\nRoss: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we\\'ve been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let\\'s see now he had the trampoline.\\nPhoebe: He broke that.\\nRoss: Well, he had gravity boots.\\nRachel: Yeah, he broke those too.\\nJoey: So he likes to break stuff.\\nRoss: Okay, I\\'ve got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn\\'t he used to have a cat?\\nPhoebe: I wouldn\\'t bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.\\nJoey: Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.\\nRoss: Right.\\nRachel: Hello!  It\\'s Chandler.\\nPhoebe:  Hello you.\\nChandler: Hello Phoebe, I\\'ve been thinking about you all day.\\nPhoebe: Eh?\\nChandler: Well you know that thing you said before, I\\'d be lying if I said I wasn\\'t intrigued.\\nPhoebe: Really?\\nChandler: Yeah, listen, Joey isn\\'t gonna be here tonight so why don\\'t you come over and I\\'ll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.\\nPhoebe: I\\'ll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye!  Oh my God!

He\\'s gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.\\nRoss: Oh that\\'s nice.\\nSteve: Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or\\nRoss: Oh. Uhh\\nSteve: Oh look, you don\\'t have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.\\nRoss: No-no, it\\'s not that, it\\'s just I-I just moved in.\\nSteve: Well, the guy\\'s worked here for 25 years.\\nRoss: Yes, but I\\'ve lived here for 25 minutes.\\nSteve: Oh, okay, I get it.\\nRoss: No wait, look.

Welcome to the building.\\nRoss:  Ugh, can you believe that guy!\\nPhoebe: Yeah. I really like his glasses.\\nRoss: so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y\\'know what I\\'m gonna do? I\\'m gonna throw a party. That\\'s right. For everyone in the building, and I\\'m gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I\\'m just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.\\nChandler:  Sounds like a fun party.\\nRachel: Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don\\'t you just pay the hundred bucks? The party\\'s gonna cost you way more than that.\\nRoss: It doesn\\'t matter! It\\'s my principles! We\\'re talking about my principles!\\nRachel: Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.\\nRoss: Oh, they\\'ll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.\\nRachel: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.\\nChandler: Very, very funny, but don\\'t say things like that in front of Monica. I don\\'t want you putting any ideas in her head.\\nRachel: Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica\\'s head.\\nChandler: Wh-wh-why?!\\nRachel: Well, because she loves you and because you love her.\\nChandler: Yeah, so, what\\'s that supposed to mean?!\\nRachel: Hey, Chandler, don\\'t freak out! I\\'m telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn\\'t want to have babies. And she\\'s a woman, and she\\'s almost 30, and y\\'know it\\'s Monica.\\nChandler: I don\\'t see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who\\'s to say what she wants?! Im right. I\\'m right. Am I right?\\nRachel: No, you\\'re right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.\\nChandler: Okay. It\\'s not different at all, is it?\\nRachel: Not unless different means the same.\\nKatie: You were so funny with that waiter! You\\'re such a nut!\\nJoey:  Y\\'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.\\nKatie: No, you make them funny. You\\'re the funny one!\\nJoey: Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone\\'s hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.\\nKatie: Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don\\'t make fun of me because of my size!\\nMonica: Isn\\'t this great?\\nChandler: Hmm.\\nMonica: Couldn\\'t you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn\\'t you just stay here forever?\\nChandler: Yeah, here, somewhere else, y\\'know where-where ever.\\nMonica: Are you okay?\\nChandler: Yeah, I\\'m cool. Casual.\\nMonica: What-what are you doing?\\nChandler: I\\'m just hanging out. Y\\'know, having fun. Y\\'know with the girl that I\\'m seeing casually.\\nMonica: Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!\\nChandler: What?!\\nMonica: Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.\\nChandler: Well, you do want all that stuff, right?\\nMonica: Oh and you know what I want!\\nChandler: Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!\\nMonica: I do not have baby fever!\\nChandler: Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that\\'s related to babies and-and marriage! I\\'ve got an idea, why don\\'t we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!\\nMonica: Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn\\'t about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!\\nChandler: Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!\\nMonica: You don\\'t know everything. Did you know that I\\'m going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can\\'t even look at you right now?!\\nChandler: Well, I did not know that.\\nCommercial Break\\nChandler: It\\'s gonna be okay, right? I mean she\\'s not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.\\nRoss and Joey: Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.\\nChandler: By me?\\nRoss: Oh, no!\\nJoey: No-no.\\nRoss: Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.\\nJoey: Yeah, big!\\nJoey: Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.\\nMonica: Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?\\nChandler: Monica.\\nMonica: I\\'m still not done not wanting to talk to you.\\nChandler: Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.\\nMonica: What?!\\nChandler: Well, that\\'s what we do. Y\\'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y\\'know you think I\\'m all cute again.\\nMonica: Really? I\\'m really tired of being your relationship tutor. You\\'re gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y\\'know what? If you\\'re too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don\\'t be in one.\\nParty Guests:  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!

This way I\\'m just y\\'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That\\'s always fun to be.\\nRoss: Yeah, but you\\'re making me look bad!\\nPhoebe: No I\\'m not. No!

But it\\'s not obvious why.\\nJoey: Well look, Im breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y\\'know? I mean, if she hits me when she\\'s happy, can you imagine how hard she\\'s gonna hit me when I tell her I\\'m taking away the Joey love?\\nKatie:  Hi!\\nJoey: Hey! Hiya!\\nRachel: Hey! Hey, cute jacket!\\nKatie: Oh, thanks! That\\'s so sweet!\\nRachel: Oh! Ow!\\nKatie: Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that?

Are you gonna?\\nJoey: Nah.\\nRoss:  Phoebe?\\nPhoebe:\\nRoss:  Phoebe? Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Ooh.\\nRoss: Look, this is a disaster! Can\\'t I please just go?\\nPhoebe: No! No! I\\'m talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?\\nRoss: So uh, what did you tell them about me?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y\\'know, try to get some sympathy.\\nRoss: Ohh.\\nPhoebe: But somehow you came off as the bad guy.\\nRoss: What?!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y\\'know, we should talk about that because I don\\'t totally understand what happened there.\\nRoss:  Ohh, this cake is really good!\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!\\nGuest #2:  Who would do a think like that?\\nSteve: 3-B!\\nAll: Oh yeah, aww!\\nSteve: Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone\\'s fun! Don\\'t you think it\\'s time you went home?!\\nGuest #3: Yeah, leave!\\nAll: Yeah, get out! Now!\\nSteve: Go back to 3-B, 3-B!\\nPhoebe: All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross?  cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.\\nPhoebe: Obviously I didn\\'t think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.\\nRoss: Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.\\nChandler: Where\\'s Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It\\'s urgent! Is she here?\\nMonica:  I\\'m Monica.\\nChandler: I need to talk to you, it\\'s urgent!\\nMonica: Okay.\\nChandler: Okay, I\\'ve been doing a lot of thinking about us, y\\'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there\\'s only one-one way to do this.\\nMonica: Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!\\nChandler:  Monica\\nMonica: No-no, don\\'t-don\\'t-don\\'t do it!\\nChandler: Will you marry me?\\nRoss: Oh-no. No. No.\\nJoey: What a bad idea!\\nRachel: Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!\\nMonica: Chandler, why are you doing this?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know. But I know I\\'m not afraid to do this.\\nMonica: Chandler.\\nChandler: I\\'m doing this because I\\'m sorry?\\nMonica: Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you\\'re sorry?\\nChandler: No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y\\'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?\\nMonica:  Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.\\nChandler: Yeah, I\\'m kinda wishing everyone wasn\\'t here right now.\\nMonica: Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!\\nChandler: Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.\\nMonica: Who? Two divorces and Joey?!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nJoey: She\\'s right y\\'know.\\nRoss: Yeah, but still, cheap shot!\\nMonica: Y\\'know what? Y\\'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you\\'re not ready for that.\\nChandler: I didn\\'t think I was!\\nMonica: Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?\\nChandler: Well I would\\'ve been happy because I would\\'ve be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would\\'ve seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.\\nEnding Credits\\nJoey: Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?\\nRoss: No, I will not!\\nJoey: Oh, it\\'s okay. You don\\'t have to be so mean about it.\\nRoss: You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. Will you marry me?\\nPhoebe: Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.\\nRachel: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I\\'m not sure, Chandler?\\nChandler: Okay, how long is this going to go on.\\nMonica: Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.\\nRoss: This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole \"We were on a break thing?\" Well, I\\'m sorry, will you marry me?\\nChandler: That\\'s not funny.\\nJoey: That\\'s not funny at all!\\nEnd\\n======== 05-16\\nStory by: Alicia Sky Varinaitis Teleplay by: Gigi McCreery & Perry Rein Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nJoey: What are you guys doing up?\\nChandler: Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed.

Why?!\\nMonica: What is going on with you?\\nJoey: Nothing!\\nChandler: Oh, come on! You\\'ve been acting strange all day!\\nJoey: All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,\\nChandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I dont want to talk about it.\\nJoey: Well, it involved Monica.\\nChandler: You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!\\nJoey: Don\\'t worry, there wasn\\'t any sex in it or anything. I haven\\'t dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.\\nMonica: What was the dream about?\\nJoey: Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y\\'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that\\'s it. I\\'m in love with Monica and I\\'ll be moving out.\\nMonica: Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesnt mean that-that you\\'re in love with me!\\nJoey: It-it doesnt?\\nMonica: No!\\nChandler: No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you\\'re jealous because I\\'ve become the apartment stud.\\nJoey: That kinda sounds like your dream dude.\\nMonica: Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y\\'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.\\nJoey: In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.\\nMonica: Um-hmm.\\nChandler: Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?\\nJoey:  Not really.\\nChandler: Well there you have it!\\nMonica: Well sure! I\\'m just wearing sweats!  But that\\'s good that you\\'re not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!\\nJoey: No, I don\\'t think it\\'s just about just getting a girlfriend. Y\\'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y\\'know are we ever going to have y\\'know the closeness like-like you guys have?\\nChandler: Well y\\'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that\\'s it?\\nJoey: Friends first? That\\'s interesting.\\nMonica: You become friends after?\\nJoey: No, never done that either.\\nRachel:  Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?\\nChandler: Oh yeah, it\\'s actually in my bedroom.\\nMonica:  That\\'s right.\\nRachel:  What\\'s up Joey?\\nJoey:  How you doin\\'?\\nCommercial Break\\nPhoebe: Excuse me, is this your car?\\nGuy: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: Well I don\\'t think it\\'s very nice of you to park here, y\\'know you\\'re blocking the entrance.\\nGuy: Don\\'t worry about it. It\\'s not a problem.\\nPhoebe: Well, it\\'s a problem for me, which means it\\'s a problem for you \\'cause I\\'m a cop.\\nGuy:  So am I!\\nPhoebe: Ohh, no.\\nCop:  Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?\\nPhoebe: I-I\\'m with the umm, the 57th.\\nCop: Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m in vice. Yeah, in fact I\\'m undercover right now. I\\'m a whore.\\nCop: Who-who else is in vice up there?\\nPhoebe: Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?\\nCop: Sipowicz? No, I don\\'t think so.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.\\nCop: No, I don\\'t know him.\\nPhoebe:  Dont try to call him or anything, \\'cause he\\'s not there, he\\'s out. His umm, his partner just died.\\nCop: Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I\\'m real sorry for his loss.\\nPhoebe: I-I sure will, take care.\\nCop:  And where did you find my badge?\\nPhoebe: Oh.\\nRachel: Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?\\nJoey: Oh, I\\'d love too, but I got acting class. But y\\'know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you.\\nRachel: Thanks!\\nJoey: Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.\\nRachel: I know.\\nJoey: Yeah that\\'s not such a bad situation they got going over there. I\\'m thinking of getting me one of those.\\nRachel: What\\'s up Joe?\\nJoey: Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great\\nRachel: Yeah?\\nJoey: is because they were friends first. Y\\'know? So I asked myself, \"Who are my friends?\" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So\\nRachel:  What are you saying?\\nJoey: I\\'m saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.\\nRachel: Y\\'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don\\'t think we should be cranking anything up.\\nJoey: I\\'ll treat you real nice.\\nRachel:  Yeah, well, y\\'know umm No honey, listen I think it\\'s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y\\'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don\\'t hit on your existing friends!\\nJoey: Won\\'t-won\\'t that take longer?\\nRachel: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it\\'s so worth the wait.\\nJoey: Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!\\nRoss: Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.\\nRachel:  Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.\\nRoss: Oh great! What, you brought Joey?\\nRachel: Well, I brought the next best thing.\\nChandler:  Hey!\\nRoss: Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!\\nChandler: Y\\'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so\\nRoss: Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we\\'re gonna do it.\\nRachel: Whoa-oh, what\\'s-what\\'s that?\\nRoss: Oh, that\\'s me.\\nRachel: Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.\\nRoss: No! That\\'s-that\\'s my arm!\\nChandler:  Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.\\nRoss: Y\\'know what? Just-just follow my lead.\\nRachel: Okay!\\nChandler: Okay.\\nRoss: Come on, Chandler.\\nRoss: All right.  Okay, here we go!\\nRoss: All right, ready?\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nRoss: Turn.\\nChandler:  Okay.\\nRoss: Turn! Turn!\\nChandler: Okay, I don\\'t think we can turn anymore!\\nRachel: Ross, I don\\'t, I just don\\'t think it\\'s going to fit.\\nRoss: Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!\\nChandler: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!\\nRoss: Okay, I don\\'t think it\\'s going to pivot anymore.\\nChandler and Rachel: You think?!\\nRoss: All right, let\\'s uh, let\\'s bring it back down and-and try again.\\nChandler: Okay, yeah, I think it\\'s really stuck now.\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe that didn\\'t work!\\nRachel: I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!\\nChandler: Oh, y\\'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?\\nJoey:  Hey!\\nRachel: Hey! How\\'s it going? Did you make any new friends?\\nJoey: Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.\\nChandler:  Hey, whoa-whoa! What\\'s she like?\\nJoey: Uhh, well, she\\'sreally good in bed.\\nMonica: Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!\\nJoey:  Well look, hey, it\\'s all your fault!\\nRachel: What?! Why?!\\nJoey: Well because you didn\\'t give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y\\'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!\\nMonica: What about the closeness?\\nJoey: Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!\\nJoey:  All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!\\nChandler: Ooh, I do! I do! I do!\\nJoey:  Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?\\nMonica: Who is it?\\nVoice: N.Y.P.D!!\\nPhoebe and Joey: Oh my God!\\nJoey: Uhh, just a minute officer!!\\nCop: I\\'m looking for Phoebe Buffay!\\nPhoebe: Ooh, God, it\\'s him! It\\'s that cop! God, I can\\'t believe it! He found me!\\nRachel: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!\\nPhoebe: Well, if I\\'m going down, I\\'m taking you  Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you\\'ll never make it stick and you know it!\\nCop: Yeah, but I kinda don\\'t have a choice, it\\'s my job. I mean, you understand right?\\nPhoebe: Yep! As long as you understand that I\\'m going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he\\'ll make you look like a fool. A fool!\\nCop: I don\\'t like looking foolish. Y\\'know what? Maybe uh, I don\\'t arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren\\'t here.\\nPhoebe: I would love it if I weren\\'t here!\\nCop: Okay, so since umm, you\\'re not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?\\nPhoebe: Me?!\\nCop: Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can\\'t stop thinking about you. You\\'re the prettiest, fake undercover whore I\\'ve ever seen.\\nChandler and Joey: Nice!\\nPhoebe: Wow! I didn\\'t see that coming! You\\'re-you\\'re asking me out!\\nCop: Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.\\nPhoebe: Umm, yeah, I\\'d like to go out with you officer\\nCop: Gary.\\nPhoebe: Gary.\\nGary: Okay, so it\\'s a date.\\nPhoebe: Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?\\nGary: Well you\\'re fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.\\nPhoebe: Ohh, impressive.\\nGary: Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you\\'ve done some pretty weird stuff.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, we\\'ll talk at dinner.\\nGary: Okay.  So I\\'ll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?\\nPhoebe: All right, I can\\'t wait!\\nGary: Okay. And don\\'t worry, I\\'m not just gonna take you out for donuts.\\nChandler:  He has a gun!\\nClosing Credits\\nRoss: I\\'d like to return this couch. I\\'m not satisfied with it.\\nThe Saleswoman: You wanna return this couch?  It\\'s cut in half!\\nRoss: That\\'s what I\\'m telling you.\\nThe Saleswoman: Did you cut this couch in half?\\nRoss: This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!\\nThe Saleswoman: You\\'re telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!\\nRoss: Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.\\nThe Saleswoman: I\\'ll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.\\nRoss:  I take it.\\nEnd\\n======== 05-17\\nWritten by: Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\nRachel: Good, you guys are all here!\\nRoss: Hey!

Isn\\'t that the girl that waved at you the other day?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know. But I can see through your sheet.  Yeah, yeah, that\\'s her. But y\\'know what? Doesn\\'t matter, I\\'m never gonna get to meet her anyway.\\nMonica: Why?\\nJoey: Because it\\'s impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.\\nMonica: What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!\\nJoey: No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.\\nMonica: No, those first two windows,  that\\'s the lobby.

I can\\'t believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.\\nRoss: So uhh, you ready?\\nJen: Sure, I\\'ll just get my coat.  Could you get that?\\nRoss: Sure.  Joey\\nJoey: Dahhhhh!!\\nRachel: Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.\\nMr. Zelner: That\\'s quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.\\nRachel:  Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.\\nMr. Zelner: Fair enough.\\nRachel: Now you\\'re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr\\nMr. Zelner: Zelner.\\nRachel: Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.\\nMr. Zelner: Y\\'know what? I may regret this but uh, I\\'m going to give you a shot.\\nRachel:  Oh! You are?\\nMr. Zelner: Um-hmm.\\nRachel: Really? Oh thank you!

We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!\\nMonica: The park huh? A public place.\\nGary: Uh-huh.\\nMonica: I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!\\nMonica: Hi Chandler.\\nChandler: Monica! This is the Men\\'s room!  Isn\\'t it?\\nMonica: Yes it is. You see I\\'ve always found the men\\'s bathroom very sexual. Haven\\'t you?\\nChandler: No. And if I did, I don\\'t think we\\'d be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!\\nMonica: Come on, we can\\'t let them win!\\nChandler: Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!\\nMonica: Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can\\'t-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!\\nChandler:  So?\\nMonica: I feel really sad that we\\'re notreally there anymore.\\nChandler: Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?\\nMonica: Wasn\\'t it a lot more exciting when we were y\\'know all over each other all the time?\\nChandler: Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I\\'m more excited about where we are right now.\\nMonica: Really?\\nChandler: Yeah! I\\'ve never been in a relationship that\\'s lasted this long before. Y\\'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that\\'s pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that\\'s pretty exciting.\\nMonica: That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.\\nChandler: Yeah?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nChandler: Y\\'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.\\nMonica: Did not.\\nChandler: Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!\\nMonica: Okay, I freaked out a little.\\nChandler: Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!  And now we\\'re back.\\nEnding Credits\\nRachel:  I cannot believe Ross is buying this!\\nMonica: Thank God! I can\\'t watch him anymore!\\nChandler:  You guys ready fore the movies?\\nRachel: Yeah!

You got it?\\nChandler: Oh yes.\\nJoey:\\nChandler:  Yes.\\nCarol:  Hey guys!\\nRoss: Hi!\\nChandler: Hi there!\\nBen: Hi!!\\nCarol: Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!\\nPhoebe: What are you talking about?!\\nRoss:  Well, it\\'s not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y\\'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he\\'s auditioning.\\nJoey:  Man! I\\'ve been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.\\nRoss: I know, it\\'s crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings\\nJoey: I\\'m always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!\\nChandler: That.\\nOpening Credits\\nRachel:  Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!\\nJoey: Luck!\\nChandler: Hey Rach, now that you\\'re working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?\\nRachel: Uh well, y\\'know what? I don\\'t think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day\\nChandler: Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.\\nMonica: Besides, if anybody\\'s gonna get free stuff, it\\'s gonna be me.\\nRachel: Okay guys, way to wish me luck!\\nAll: Good luck! Go get \\'em!\\nPhoebe: Okay, let\\'s discuss Rachel\\'s birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.\\nJoey: Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn\\'t like for another month.\\nPhoebe: Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it\\'s not a surprise.\\nMonica: I think it\\'s a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.\\nJoey: Ross!! We\\'re having a surprise party for Rachel!!\\nRoss:  Okay!!\\nJoey: Done.\\nPhoebe: Okay, great so do you want to do it together?\\nMonica: I would love to do it together!\\nJoey: They\\'re gonna do it together.\\nChandler: Dude! That\\'s my girlfriend!\\nJoey: What, so I gotta shut it down now?\\nRoss: All right, I gotta take off. I\\'m picking up Ben then we\\'re off to the big audition.\\nMonica: It\\'s gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben\\'s dad.\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nChandler: Weirder than watching his two moms make out?\\nJoey: Whoa-whoa dad? There\\'s a dad in the commercial?\\nRoss: Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.\\nJoey: Whoa, hey, maybe I\\'ll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben\\'s father than his godfather.\\nRoss: You\\'re not his godfather.\\nJoey: What?! Are you kidding?!\\nRoss:  Okay, let\\'s go godfather.\\nJoey: All right!\\nJoey: Hey! I\\'m in, they\\'re gonna let me audition!\\nRoss: Really? That\\'s great!\\nJoey: I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her\\nCarol:  Hey, that kid looks familiar.\\nJoey: Oh yeah, yeah! He\\'s done tons of commercials. I\\'ve seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad.\\nRoss: Yeah well, he\\'s not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,\\nJoey: That\\'s great. Listen, wouldn\\'t it be great though if I got to play Ben\\'s dad?\\nRoss: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.\\nJoey: I look more like him than you do!\\nCarol: Y\\'know, I don\\'t really know you well enough for you to do that.\\nKim: So it\\'s down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?\\nRachel: Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.\\nKim: Oh don\\'t be sorry, that\\'s part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I\\'m kidding.\\nNancy: She is kidding, but don\\'t ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I\\'m kidding!\\nRachel:  Oh, what a fun office.\\nKim: I don\\'t know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we\\'ll figure this out when we come back?\\nKim:  Rachel? Do you smoke?\\nRachel: Oh no, my dad\\'s a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess\\'s right to smoke.\\nRachel: and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!\\nMonica: That doesn\\'t seem fair.\\nRachel: I know! It\\'s like I\\'m being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!\\nChandler: Yeah, it is the best.\\nRachel: I mean what if this keeps happening? Y\\'know, they\\'ll-they\\'ll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I\\'ll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y\\'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she\\'s gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?\\nMonica: Rachel, you can go down there, you don\\'t have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.\\nRachel: Yeah, I can do that.\\nChandler: Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.\\nPhoebe:  Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?\\nRachel: I would love to!\\nPhoebe: Oh good!\\nChandler: Yeah, I wanna go to babe.\\nPhoebe: Oh good.\\nPhoebe: Oh wait, I change my mind!\\nMonica: Yeah, me too!\\nPhoebe: Oh, look at that.\\nMonica: All right, that\\'s a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y\\'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here\\'s an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I\\'ve highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.\\nPhoebe: What happened to the intimate dinner party?\\nMonica: Oh, we\\'re not doing that. Okay\\nPhoebe: So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.\\nMonica: What?! I didn\\'t take care of everything, there\\'s-there\\'s plenty of things for you to do!\\nPhoebe: Like what?\\nMonica:  Cups.\\nPhoebe: Cups? You\\'re giving me cups?\\nMonica: And ice!\\nPhoebe: Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?  All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!\\nMonica: Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant\\nPhoebe: I got it! Mine!\\nRoss:  Hi.\\nMonica: Hey! How\\'d the audition go?!\\nRoss: Not so good.\\nMonica: Wait a minute, are you doing Joey\\'s  Yeah it did?\"\\nRoss:  Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!\\nJoey:  Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn\\'t get a callback.\\nMonica: You got a callback too didn\\'t you?\\nJoey:  Yeah I did!\\nKim: Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?\\nRachel: Oh well, it\\'s kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.\\nKim: Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.\\nRachel: Oh great!\\nKim: So anyway we really  Honey, we\\'re just smoking all over you.\\nNancy: Oh, sorry!\\nRachel: Oh that\\'s okay.\\nKim: No-no-no, we\\'ll move you just stay right there.\\nNancy: So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he\\'s very excited about the line.\\nKim: Oh that\\'s great! You are the best!\\nRachel: Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?  Okay, okay, okay, what\\'s so funny over here?\\nNancy: I thought you didn\\'t smoke.\\nRachel: Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y\\'know? Y\\'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, \"Wow, those guys are crazy!\" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.\\nKim: We get high.\\nRachel: Oh, me too.\\nKim: I\\'m kidding.\\nRachel:  Oh, me too.\\nRoss: Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?\\nJoey: Well, unfortunately, I don\\'t get many callbacks so\\nCarol: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?\\nJoey: Who knows?\\nThe Casting Director:  Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.\\nRoss: Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!\\nJoey: Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben\\'s dad!\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nThe Casting Director: Actually, that can\\'t happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we\\'re putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it\\'ll be either you two\\nJoey: Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.\\nRoss: Yeah, it is.\\nKyle: Yeah. It\\'s gonna be weird.\\nRoss: No, we-we\\'re gonna be like best friends, that\\'s why it\\'s gonna be weird.\\nKyle: Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.\\nCommercial Break\\nPhoebe:  Hey!\\nRoss and Chandler: Hi!\\nPhoebe: Is it okay if I leave this stuff here \\'til Rachel\\'s birthday party?\\nChandler: Ah sure. What\\'s in \\'em?\\nPhoebe: Umm, cups.\\nChandler: Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.\\nRoss: Seriously that\\'s a lot of cups.\\nPhoebe: Yeah well, that\\'s \\'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.\\nChandler: Y\\'know I rued the day oncedidn\\'t get a whole lot else done.\\nPhoebe: Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!\\nJoey: Hey Pheebs!  Hey!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nJoey: Ross good, I\\'m uh glad you\\'re here. I wanna talk to you about something.\\nRoss: What\\'s up?\\nJoey: Well, I\\'ve been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y\\'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can\\'t lead to anything good. So, I think I\\'m just gonna step aside. I\\'m gonna tell them that I won\\'t audition.\\nRoss: Wow, uh, Joey that\\'s-that\\'s great. Thanks man.\\nJoey: That\\'s it? You\\'re-you\\'re gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we\\'re talking about here!\\nRoss: Well, you just\\nJoey: I just said that so you wouldn\\'t let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!\\nRoss: What?!\\nJoey: What? Chandler! Tell \\'em!\\nChandler:\\nRoss: Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You\\'re like the uh, tag-a-long dad.\\nJoey: At least I care about his feelings!\\nRoss: What?!\\nJoey: Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it?\\nRoss: And why wouldn\\'t he get it?\\nJoey: Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!\\nRoss: Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?\\nJoey: You just give him a spoon baby!\\nRoss: Oh yeah?

Kim totally took my opinions.\\nMonica: You stink!\\nRachel: Thanks!\\nMonica: No, I\\'m-I\\'m serious!\\nRachel: Well-well that\\'s \\'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.

You look happy and sick; you smoked!\\nRachel: All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!\\nChandler: I wish I had smoked for my career\\nMonica: That\\'s so gross!\\nRachel: No well, no it\\'s not that bad, y\\'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.\\nChandler: Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!\\nMonica: Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I\\'m not kidding.\\nChandler: I think you smell great!\\nKim: So, we\\'re decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?\\nNancy: Absolutely!\\nRachel: I am so on board!\\nKim: Rachel didn\\'t you just light that?\\nRachel: Yeah, I did, but y\\'know what?

Maybe-maybe you didn\\'t mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.\\nJoey: What you do mean?\\nRoss: I think, sub-consciously\\nJoey: Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.\\nRoss:  I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.\\nJoey: Well, you\\'re way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It\\'s not that I\\'m a bad actor\\nRoss: No!\\nJoey: No, it\\'s just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.\\nRoss: There you go.

You are a lot hotter than I am.\\nJoey:\\nMonica: Chandler, this actually bothers you?\\nChandler: Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?\\nRachel: Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.\\nRoss: And thank you, for that.\\nRachel: But y\\'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.\\nRoss: What?  What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.\\nRachel: Oh! Y\\'know what? You\\'re right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!\\nRoss: All right, all right. You-you-you know what I\\'m going to do?

This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.\\nPhoebe:  That\\'s not good.\\nJoey:\\nRachel:  Joey, why don\\'t you just tell her what happened? It\\'s not your fault.\\nChandler:  If we keep talking this way, aren\\'t we gonna freak her out soon?\\nGrandma Tribbiani:\\nJoey: Soon, soon, I\\'m gonna be on soon.

You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?\\nPhoebe:  Why are you being weird?\\nRoss: Do you like it?\\nPhoebe: No, that would be, \"Why are you being cute?\"\\nRoss: Okay, I\\'m working on my flirting.\\nPhoebe: Ohh! I did not get that.\\nChandler: So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?\\nMonica: Yeah, it\\'s good.\\nChandler: See, I\\'m finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!\\nMonica: Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it\\'s okay for you to flirt, but not for me.\\nChandler: Oh, I\\'m so glad we cleared that up. Look, I\\'m sorry, some things are different for men and for women.\\nMonica: Go on, teach me something about men and women.\\nChandler: Okay, I\\'ve already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, \"I\\'m just flirting, no big deal.\" But the guy is thinking, \"Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!\"\\nMonica: No way!\\nChandler: It\\'s true.\\nMonica: Well that\\'s pathetic!\\nChandler: Again true.\\nMonica: And this goes for all guys?\\nChandler: All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.\\nJoey:  All right, it\\'s another commercial; I still haven\\'t told her!\\nRoss: Joey! This is like the last commercial. You\\'ve got like  ten minutes left!\\nJoey: I know, I know! What am I going to do?  Ooh!\\nMonica: No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!\\nJoey:\\nGrandma Tribbiani: Joey!\\nChandler: Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  So, you\\'re old and small.\\nRachel:  Hey!\\nPhoebe: Did you find it?\\nRachel: The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I\\'ve been looking for these since like last summer.\\nPhoebe: Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.\\nRachel: Okay, calm down, here they are.\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe:  What are we going to do?!\\nRachel: I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know.\\nPhoebe: All right well, we\\'re just gonna have to tell Monica, that\\'s all.\\nRachel: Oh gosh, she\\'s going to kill me.\\nPhoebe: I suppose I could tell her it\\'s just all my fault.\\nRachel: Ohh that\\'d be great!\\nPhoebe: Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?\\nMonica: Yeah, what is it?\\nPhoebe: Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I\\'m sorry! I am so, so sorry!\\nMonica:  Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.\\nPhoebe: I will replace it, I promise.

We could use a guy like you.\\nChandler: Who jumps at loud noises!\\nRoss: Wow! I could\\'ve died tonight.\\nChandler: Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y\\'know what, I think I\\'ll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.\\nRoss: I do have a newfound respect for life.\\nChandler:\\nGary:  So you wanna get some dinner?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y\\'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I\\'d throw my body on you.\\nGary: Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.\\nPhoebe: Okay!\\nGary: All right.\\nPhoebe: Bye!\\nRoss and Joey: Bye!\\nJoey: Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!\\nJoey: Dude! How come you took off?\\nChandler: Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever\\nJoey: Is something wrong?\\nChandler: No. No I\\'m just tired. Y\\'know, from-from the walk.\\nJoey: Okay.\\nChandler: You dove in front of Ross! Ross!\\nJoey: That\\'s what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!\\nChandler: I do not hate Ross!\\nJoey: Of course you do! I saved him! You\\'re mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.\\nChandler: What picture?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know, but I don\\'t like what I\\'m hearing!\\nChandler: Look I\\'m very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y\\'know, it could\\'ve been a bullet and you y\\'know, you didn\\'t try to save me!\\nJoey: Ohh, you\\'re upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! Iknewyou could take care of yourself. Y\\'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He\\'s not street like us!\\nChandler: When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That\\'s the bottom line.\\nJoey: Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn\\'t trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.\\nChandler: From a bullet!\\nJoey: I know it doesn\\'t make much sense\\nChandler: Much sense?!\\nJoey: Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!\\nChandler: So you risked your life, for a sandwich!\\nJoey: I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!\\nChandler: So you didn\\'t uh, choose Ross before me.\\nJoey: No! I would never do that! You-you\\'re like my brother!\\nChandler: Really?!\\nJoey: Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.\\nChandler: Thanks.\\nJoey: No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it\\'s not a hot dog!\\nJoey: How good is that?\\nChandler:  Oh-oi-ho, yeah!\\nJoey: See?\\nChandler: Hm-hmm.\\nJoey: Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!\\nChandler: I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.\\nJoey: Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!\\nRachel: Hey! Hi!\\nRoss: Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?\\nRachel: Hey! Y\\'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!\\nRoss: Y\\'know, it-it doesn\\'t matter. The important thing is that you\\'re here. You\\'re my friend, and you\\'re here. Oh!\\nRachel: Okay, just a little scared. What\\'s going on Ross?\\nRoss: The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!\\nRachel: What?! What? What happened?!\\nRoss: Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nRoss: And somebody took a shot at me!\\nRachel:  Really?!\\nRoss: No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, II survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y\\'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.\\nRachel: Because a car backfired?\\nRoss:  Okay, why are you here?\\nRachel: Well, I-I-I don\\'t know how this fits into your whole \"seizing\" thing but um, Emily called you today.\\nRoss: You talked to her?\\nRachel: No, she left a message.  something wrong with your machine.\\nRoss: Well, okay, what-what did she say?\\nRachel: Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.\\nRoss: Wow!\\nRachel: Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?\\nRoss: Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!\\nRachel: Okay. Thank you! Thank you! BecauseI\\'m sorry, all right. Because y\\'know what? She didn\\'t want menot important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.  Your decision.\\nRoss: Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.\\nRachel: Okay, no, that\\'s not the right decision. That\\'s not, that\\'s not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?\\nRoss: Okay, look, yesterday I would\\'ve even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!\\nRachel: Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!\\nRoss: You weren\\'t there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I\\'m supposed to seize! Y\\'know?\\nRachel: Okay, y\\'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.\\nRoss: Huh.\\nRachel: I mean, look-look today you escaped  death, y\\'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?\\nRoss: That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don\\'t wanna see or talk to her.\\nRachel: Well, there you go!\\nRoss: Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.\\nRachel:  Close call day.\\nRoss: Hey, thanks Rach.\\nRachel: Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.\\nRoss: Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn\\'t erase it.\\nRachel: Oh?\\nRoss:  Oh yeah, no that\\'s-that\\'s an old message, nobody needs to hear that.\\nRachel: No.\\nRoss:  Hey umm, was-was Monica here?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nRoss: Yeah, I want my money back.\\nRachel:  Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?\\nEnding Credits\\nRoss: Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?\\nPhoebe: Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It\\'s not really a good story.\\nRoss: I wonder how I would react under fire, y\\'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.\\nMonica: Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.\\nChandler: Before or after you were shot by your own troops?\\nRoss: I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.\\nChandler: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.\\nJoey: Yeah, hero sandwiches.\\nPhoebe: Well you all know that I\\'m a pacifist so I\\'m not interested in war in any way.  Not you Joey.\\nEnd\\n======== 05-21\\nTeleplay by: Greg Malins Story by: Scott Silveri Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\nGary:  Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?\\nPhoebe: I\\'m fine, thanks.\\nChandler:  Yeah, see, I can\\'t pull of baby-doll can I?\\nMonica: No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I\\'m gonna get some tea.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nChandler: Hiya doin\\' pumpkin?\\nPhoebe: Nope.\\nMonica: So it looks like it\\'s going really well for you two, huh?\\nGary: I know, really well. In fact, I\\'m gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.\\nMonica:  Oh my God!\\nGary: What do you, what do you think?\\nMonica: I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?\\nGary: Tonight, but don\\'t say anything. Okay?\\nMonica: I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I\\'m so excited! {And I just can\\'t hide it! I\\'m about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn\\'t resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y\\'know, she cries when they die, and there\\'s the whole funeral\\nGary:\\nPhoebe: Okay. Bye!\\nPhoebe: So, what movie should we see?\\nMonica:  Gary\\'s gonna ask you to move in with him!!\\nPhoebe: What?! Really?!\\nMonica: He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn\\'t hold it in any longer!\\nPhoebe: I can\\'t believe this!\\nChandler:  Right, because it\\'s fast. Because, it\\'s so fast. It\\'s fast!\\nMonica: Relax! It\\'s Phoebe! Not you!\\nChandler: Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!\\nPhoebe: No, but it is fast. Isn\\'t it?\\nMonica: Ohhhh!\\nPhoebe: No, I like him a lot but I don\\'t think I\\'m ready for this!\\nChandler: So, what are you gonna do?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know. I\\'ll just handle itI\\'ll ask you to talk to him!\\nChandler: Me?! Why me?\\nPhoebe: Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him aman!\\nChandler: I\\'ll try, but I\\'m not sure what good it would do, y\\'know? Because I\\'m a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.\\nMonica: That is so sweet!\\nChandler:\\nOpening Credits\\nJoey: Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?\\nRoss: Uh-huh, that\\'s why they call it Staten Island.\\nJoey: Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.\\nRoss:  Also an island.\\nJoey: Hey, what time is it?\\nRoss:  2:17.\\nJoey: Wow! You realize that we\\'ve been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?\\nRoss: Are you serious?!\\nJoey: Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn\\'t want to say anything \\'cause I didn\\'t want to jinx it.\\nRoss: Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!\\nJoey: Oh, I-I, I think that\\'s the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!\\nRachel:  Hey, you guys\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRachel: Is Monica here?\\nJoey and Ross: No.\\nRachel: All right listen umm, I just bought something I\\'m not sure she\\'s gonna like it, and it\\'s gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.\\nRoss: You bought Shawn Cassidy!\\nRachel: Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?\\nJoey and Ross: Yeah!\\nRachel: Okay!  Check it out!\\nRoss: What-what is it?!\\nJoey: What the hell is that?!!\\nRachel: It\\'s a, it\\'s a cat!\\nJoey: That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}\\nRachel: Yes it is!\\nRoss: Why is it inside out?!\\nRachel: Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!\\nRoss: How much did you pay for that?\\nRachel: Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.\\nRoss: Yeah? How much?\\nRachel: A thousand bucks.\\nRoss: ON A CAT??!!!!\\nJoey: It\\'s not a cat!\\nRachel: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!\\nRoss: Free cats do that too, y\\'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won\\'t die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it\\'s life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}\\nJoey: It\\'s not a cat!\\nRachel: Ugh! Look you guys, I\\'m really excited about this! Okay? I don\\'t care what you think! I\\'m gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!\\nRoss:  Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?\\nJoey: Uhh, the ball thing.\\nRoss: Yeah?\\nJoey: Hey Ross, wouldn\\'t it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!\\nRoss: Uhh, yeah it would! Let\\'s do it!\\nJoey: Okay!\\nJoey:  Uh-oh.\\nRoss: What?\\nJoey: I have to pee. And Rachel\\'s in the bathroom!\\nJoey: Man, I didn\\'t think we were gonna make it!\\nRoss: I know!  Don\\'t switch hands, okay?\\nChandler: Hey ladies! What are you in here for?\\nGary: Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?\\nChandler: Gary, I\\'m here to report a crime.\\nGary: Yeah?\\nChandler: It is a crime that you and I don\\'t spend more time together.\\nGary:  What\\'s up?\\nChandler: Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.\\nGary: Sure. Okay.\\nChandler: Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y\\'know, live-living together!\\nGary: Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.\\nChandler: You mean scared.\\nGary: No, I mean happy.\\nChandler: Scared? Happy?\\nGary: Chandler, what-what are you doing?\\nChandler: I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don\\'t you see, if you lived with Phoebe she\\'s always gonna be there. You\\'re gonna get home, she\\'s there. You go to bed, she\\'s there. You wake up and oh yes, she\\'s there!\\nGary: I know! I can\\'t wait!\\nChandler: Were you\\'re parents happy, or something?\\nGary: Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I justI wanna be around her as much as I can.\\nChandler: Wow, y\\'know when you say it, it doesn\\'t sound so scary.\\nGary: So you know what I\\'m talking about, right?\\nChandler: Yeah, I think I do! Y\\'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!\\nGary: No, it\\'s too soon for you guys.\\nChandler:  Yeah, you\\'re right about that.\\nRoss: now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!\\n{Y\\'know, sometimes I think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up. But it won\\'t work. I\\'ll always have the last laugh!  Okay, so maybe I\\'m a little deluded, it\\'s probably just my spellchecker. But, I must admit I did get Mesozoic and Paleozoic on the first attempt. Yay me! Anyhoo}\\nJoey: Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.\\n{Oh, all right! Geez, I can\\'t have any fun!}\\nMonica:  Hey guys!\\nJoey: Hi!\\nMonica: Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.  It was right here, where is it?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know.\\nMonica: All right, come on, I\\'m-I\\'m late for work!\\nRoss: How do you know? You don\\'t have a watch.\\nMonica: Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!\\nJoey: Oh, I don\\'t know. Yeah, can\\'t do it.\\nMonica: What?!\\nRoss: Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!\\nJoey: Yeah, we haven\\'t dropped it in\\nRoss: 2 hours, 27 minutes.\\nMonica: Really?!\\nMonica:\\nRoss: Hey Rach!\\nRachel: Hey.\\nRoss: Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin\\' it!\\nRachel: Oh, wow! Congratulations, that\\'s quite a waste of time.\\nMonica: Rach?\\nRachel: Yeah?\\nMonica: You have scratches all over you, what happened?\\nRachel: Well, it\\'s my cat.\\nMonica:  What?!\\nRachel: Oh yeah, I got a cat.\\nMonica: I don\\'t want a cat!\\nJoey: Oh, don\\'t worry, it\\'s not a cat.\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nRachel: You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother\\'s cat. I mean, it\\'s not sweet, it\\'s not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it\\'s saying, \"Rachel!\"\\nRoss: Doesn\\'t sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.\\nMonica:  What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!\\nRachel: Well, I was gonna let you play with it.\\nChandler: Hi!\\nPhoebe: Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?\\nChandler: Yes I did, and I think you should do it.\\nPhoebe: What?!\\nChandler: He\\'s a great guy, y\\'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.\\nPhoebe: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can\\'t even do that right! God!\\nChandler: Im sorry.  If you ask me, I\\'d move in with him.\\nPhoebe: Ohh!! God!  Get out of here, good for nothing.\\nGary: Hey Chandler.\\nChandler: Hey Gar!\\nGary:  Hi, can I talk to you for a second?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! Okay.\\nGary: You look very pretty today.\\nPhoebe: Thanks! Okay.\\nGary: Here\\'s the thing.\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nGary: Y\\'know I really want to move this relationship forward.\\nPhoebe: Uh-hmm.\\nGary: Because if you\\'re not moving forward, y\\'know you\\'re just moving backwards.\\nPhoebe: No that\\'s not true. If you\\'re not moving forward, you\\'re just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.\\nGary: Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nGary: I want you to move in with me.\\nPhoebe: That is so sweet. But don\\'t you think it\\'s a little too soon? I mean there\\'s so much we don\\'t know about each other.\\nGary:  Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.\\nPhoebe: I justI don\\'t want us to jump into something we\\'re not ready for.\\nGary:  Uh-huh.\\nPhoebe: I really don\\'t want to mess up what we have. I\\'m justI\\'m worried it\\'s gonna be a big mistake.\\nGary:  Yeah.\\nPhoebe: Which is why my answer is yes!\\nGary:  Really?!\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh!\\nCommercial Break\\nRoss:  Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We\\'re on the same team!\\nChandler: Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?\\nJoey: That\\'s right baby.\\nChandler: All right, let me in.\\nMonica:  No-no! Don\\'t do it! Don\\'t!\\nChandler: What?\\nMonica: He\\'s a dropper!\\nJoey: Oh yeah, that\\'s right!\\nChandler: I\\'m not a dropper!\\nRoss: It\\'s really a uh-uh three person game, y\\'know?\\nChandler: It\\'s throwing and catching!\\nRoss: All right.\\nChandler: Oh! Oh! That\\'s so hard.\\nJoey: Whoa-whoa you guys, it\\'s not a cat!\\nMonica: Oh myOh good God!\\nRachel:  I give up you guys, I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do with this thing!\\nRoss: Baking it didn\\'t help, huh?\\nMonica: So, why don\\'t you just take it back to where you got it?\\nRachel: I tried! They won\\'t take her back.\\nChandler: Maybe that\\'s because she\\'s a minion of the anti-Christ.\\nMonica: Rach, why won\\'t they take it back?\\nRachel: Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?\\nMonica: Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.\\nRachel: No Mon that\\'s not the point. I\\'m out a thousand dollars, I\\'m all scratched up, and I\\'m stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!\\nMonica: Oh my God, the cat\\'s made my eyes water! Don\\'t-don\\'t throw it to me! My vision\\'s been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It\\'s okay. Man, that was close.\\nChandler: Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.\\nPhoebe and Gary:  Hey!\\nAll: Hey!\\nGary: We have great news!\\nPhoebe: We\\'re moving in together! Isn\\'t it great! Yay!\\nAll: Congratulations! Congrats!\\nPhoebe: I know, I\\'m so excited!\\nGary: So am I!\\nPhoebe: Well, you\\'re not more excited than I am! No way! I\\'m the most excited!\\nGary: Okay, I\\'ll see you at the station later.\\nPhoebe: Okay, yeah, I\\'ll see you later! Don\\'t forget about the moving in!\\nGary: All right.\\nMonica: So you\\'re moving in with him. What happened?\\nPhoebe: I couldn\\'t tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it\\'ll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I\\'ll save on stamps.\\nMonica: Why, do you write him a lot?\\nPhoebe: No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don\\'t they?\\nAll: Yeah! That\\'s right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'m sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.\\nGary: Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?\\nPhoebe: No, nothing.\\nGary: Oh really?\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nGary: Nothing at all?\\nPhoebe: No, as soon as something opens up we\\'ll move right in. Unless it doesn\\'t have a pool, I need a pool.\\nGary: Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh!\\nGary: Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?\\nPhoebe:  Yeah, I feel great. \\'Cause we\\'re moving in together.\\nGary: So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.  Can I get some water?\\nGary: In a minute. You-you checked today\\'s Post?\\nPhoebe: Umm, yeah! Today\\'s.\\nGary: \\'Cause uh, this is today\\'s Post  Brooklyn Heights!\\nPhoebe:  Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!\\nGary: Let me tell you what I think might be going on.  Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, \"Yes\" but now she\\'s having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?\\nPhoebe: Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts!\\nGary: Phoebe\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nGary: Phoebe, it\\'s okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there\\'s a lot of things we don\\'t know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don\\'t know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.\\nPhoebe: That\\'s so sweet.\\nGary: Sweethart, but none of that matters if it\\'s too soon for you. It\\'s fine! We don\\'t have to move in together. I justI want you to be happy\\nPhoebe: Living with you would make me happy.\\nGary: Phoebe, you don\\'t have to say that.\\nPhoebe: No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!\\nGary: Are you sure?\\nPhoebe: Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let\\'s live in an apartment that we both live in!\\nGary: Oh that\\'s great!\\nPhoebe: Oh wait, one sec.

What an unusual cat!\\nRachel: Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?\\nWoman No. 2: Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter  but Okay, why not?\\nRachel: Oh, terrific! That\\'ll be $2,000.\\nWoman No. 2: What?!\\nRachel: Okay, a thousand.\\nWoman No. 2: I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.\\nRachel: Well, I do, but you\\'re just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.\\nWoman No. 2: Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.\\nRachel:  Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?\\nRoss: I\\'m starving!\\nMonica: Come on guys! Suck it up! We\\'re closing in on ten hours! It\\'s gut-check time!\\nJoey: I don\\'t know who made you the boss? All right?

Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?\\nChandler: What?\\nMonica: I love you.\\n{There\\'s another continuity error here. Before Monica says I love you, Chandler\\'s holding the vests so that you couldn\\'t see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. After she says the line and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. Hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}\\nJoey: Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y\\'know? I\\'m gonna miss him!\\nPhoebe: Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!\\nChandler: Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?\\nJoey: Uh no, not really. It\\'s an independent film y\\'know? So we don\\'t have a real big budget. I figured I\\'d just stay in your room.\\nChandler: I see, but once you get your first paycheck you\\'ll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?\\nJoey: Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey\\'s pocket.\\nChandler: So you don\\'t get paid unless the movie makes money?\\nJoey: Did you not hear the plot of the movie? \"She\\'s been dead for ten years.\" I\\'m gonna be a millionaire!\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRoss: I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.\\nJoey: You got it!\\nRoss: All right!\\nChandler: All right, bye-bye now!\\nPhoebe: Bye!\\nRachel: Bye you guys!\\nJoey: Bye-bye!\\nMonica: I wanna say good-bye at the car!\\nChandler: Okay!\\nJoey: Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?\\nRachel: Oh honey, I\\'ll say good-bye to you at the car if you don\\'t mind the puss.\\nJoey: See ya!\\nRachel: Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it\\'s healing!\\nRoss: Hey Pheebs, what \\'cha reading?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t see you there.\\nRoss: Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? \\'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!\\nPhoebe: Well, if you don\\'t know I can\\'t help you.\\nRoss: Well, I don\\'t know.\\nPhoebe: Well, I can\\'t help you.\\nRoss: Well, whatever it is I\\'m-I\\'m very, very sorry.

Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know! I don\\'t remember!\\nRoss: Well if you can\\'t remember, can\\'t we just forget about this?\\nPhoebe: Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.\\nJoey: Man, I\\'m getting pretty tired. You\\'re might have to take over soon.\\nChandler: We\\'ve been driving for a half-hour, and you haven\\'t looked at the road once.\\nJoey: Don\\'t worry, it\\'s out there!  I think I just need lunch.\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nJoey: You wanna eat?  My treat!\\nChandler: Isn\\'t that Ross\\'s money?\\nJoey: Yeah. Okay. Ross\\'s treat! Where do you wanna eat?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know.\\nJoey: Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I\\'m gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!\\nChandler: Okay!\\nJoey: Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?\\nChandler: Too dry.\\nJoey: Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?\\nChandler: No!\\nJoey: Is this movie gonna be my big break?\\nChandler: No!\\nJoey:  What?!\\nChandler: Yes.\\nJoey: Dude you said, \"No!\"\\nChandler: I also said, \"Yes!\"\\nJoey: You don\\'t think this is going to be a big break for me?\\nChandler: No!  Ahhh!!!\\nJoey: I don\\'t believe this!\\nChandler: Look Joe, I just, I just don\\'t want to get your hopes up real high.\\nJoey: What are you talking about?! I\\'m the lead in a movie!\\nChandler: They\\'re not even paying ya! This doesn\\'t even sound like a real movie!\\nJoey: Y\\'know what? I don\\'t need this! Okay? I don\\'t know why you\\'re dumping all over my big break.\\nChandler: Joe, I don\\'t think this is going to be your big break.\\nJoey: Is that why you\\'re on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? \\'Cause if it is, I\\'ll tell ya, I-I-I\\'d rather be alone.\\nChandler: Oh, you don\\'t want me on the trip?\\nJoey: Not if you\\'re gonna be like this!\\nChandler: All right, I\\'ll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I\\'ll lie.\\nJoey: Yeah! I don\\'t want you on the trip!\\nChandler: All right, fine! Fine! Why don\\'t you pull over? I\\'ll get out right now!\\nJoey: Fine!  Get out!\\nChandler: You\\'re not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.\\nJoey: Get out!!\\nChandler: All right!!  Wait! Wait, there\\'s no sidewalk! Yeah, I\\'m gonna die here.\\nCommercial Break\\nRoss: Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?\\nPhoebe: No.\\nRoss: Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?\\nPhoebe: No that made me feel precious.\\nMonica: Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he\\'s always correcting people\\'s grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it\\'s who!\\nRoss: Yeah? Sometimes it\\'s\\nRachel: Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.\\nRoss: Okay, I\\'m the baby.\\nRachel: Eh! Stop it!\\nChandler:  Hey!\\nMonica: Chandler!

Y\\'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.\\nPhoebe: That game should not be played without my supervision.\\nChandler: Well, I don\\'t know what mad him so mad, y\\'know? All I said was that uh, I didn\\'t think this wasn\\'t gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn\\'t going to do anything for him, and that uh, y\\'know it didn\\'t sound like a real movie--Okay, he should\\'ve pushed me off of the bridge.\\nPhoebe: What\\'s in the bag?\\nChandler: Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?\\nPhoebe: I do!\\nRachel: Okay.\\nMonica: Not even close.\\nRachel: Okay, then y\\'know what? Help me! I need help! I can\\'t do this!\\nMonica: Okay! All right! Let\\'s do it!\\nRachel: All right!\\nMonica: Sit down.\\nRachel: All right.\\nMonica: Put your head back.\\nRachel: Yes!\\nMonica: All right.\\nRachel: Okay.\\nMonica: Now, open your eyes.\\nRachel: Okay, they are.\\nMonica: How many fingers am I holding up?\\nRachel:  Four.\\nMonica: Oh my God, I was thinking four.\\nRachel: Really?!\\nMonica: Yes!

Well, howd she take it?\\nMonica: Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad.\\nChandler: And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?\\nMonica: I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Dont I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!\\nJoey: Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! Its like the end of an era!

But, I-I do not love her.\\nRussell: Oh, thats better then.\\nRoss: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.\\nRussell: I see. Have you considered therapy?\\nRoss: I think just the annulment for today.\\nRussell: There are a couple of forms to fill out.\\nRoss: Easy.\\nRussell: And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.\\nRoss: No problem.\\nRussell: And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.\\nRoss: Ooh! Theres no way to do this without her? Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.\\nRussell: Of course you did. Look Ross, you cant get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.\\nRoss: Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.\\nRachel: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.\\nRachel: Okay!\\nMonica: Yknow, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.\\nRachel: Okay.\\nMonica: Hey Rach, what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I dont know if I want it because it might be yknow, too many memories!\\nRachel:  What the hell is that?\\nMonica: I dont know.  Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.\\nRachel: Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!\\nMonica: Something to remember me by!\\nRachel: Mon, honey youre not dying. Im just moving out. Yknow, I mean were gonna see each other all the time.\\nMonica: But still, its a big change. The end of an era, you might say!\\nRachel: Are you okay? Youre not blinking.\\nMonica: Im fine! I just, Im thinking how much its an end of era.\\nRachel: Oh, all right. But yknow I gotta say, I dont, I dont think six years counts as an era.\\nMonica: An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you!\\nRachel: What is the matter with you?!\\nMonica: What is the matter with you?!! Why arent you more upset?! Arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean arent you gonna miss me at all?!\\nRachel: All right, fine, but dont get mad at me. Its-its just a little hard to believe.\\nMonica: Whats hard to believe?\\nRachel: Well yknow, its you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Yknow? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess Im not upset because I dont see you guys going through with it. Im sorry.\\nMonica: Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.\\nRachel: But I\\nMonica: No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.\\nRachel: It is? Really?\\nMonica: Yeah, sweetie.\\nRachel:  I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?\\nMonica: No.\\nRachel: What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!\\nMonica: Im gonna miss you!\\nRachel: I mean its the end of an era!\\nMonica: I know!\\nPhoebe:  Okay, bye!\\nRoss: Oh no.\\nPhoebe: So? Did you get the annulment?\\nRoss: I couldnt.\\nPhoebe: I knew it! Because you love Rachel.\\nRoss: Its not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I\\nPhoebe: Yeah, complicated cause of the love.\\nRoss: I I do, I do not love Rachel.

Umm, she took it really well.\\nPhoebe: You didnt tell her did you?\\nRoss: No.\\nPhoebe: Of course not, because youre in love with her.\\nRoss: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.\\nPhoebe: What do you mean, comforted her?\\nRoss: Its nothing, I just gave her a hug.\\nPhoebe: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!\\nRoss: Its also a sign of friendship.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.\\nRoss:  It was a hug!\\nPhoebe: Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?\\nRoss: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?\\nPhoebe: Ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head! Thats why, thats why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, youre a scientist.\\nRoss: I was hugging her as a friend. Its not my fault her-her hair got in my face, shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesnt mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!\\nPhoebe:  Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachels not in the same place you are.\\nRoss:  If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!\\nPhoebe: Okay, I didnt understand that, but yknow, maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love!\\nJoey: Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.\\nChandler: Who was it?\\nJoey: I dont know! How about, \"Thanks for taking the message.\" Jeez!\\nMonica: Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?\\nChandler: Sure!\\nMonica: Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.\\nChandler: Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!\\nMonica: No.\\nChandler: Okay so you mean no as in, \"Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely.\"\\nMonica: Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.\\nChandler: So, thats it?\\nMonica: I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.\\nChandler: Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Its the oldest game!\\nMonica: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?\\nChandler: I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!\\nMonica: Are you mocking me?\\nChandler: No, Im not mocking you,\\nJoey: Hey, whats up?\\nChandler: Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.\\nJoey: But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.\\nChandler:  \"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\" Nice!\\nJoey: Yeah? I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me. And whats more different than me; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh?  Not just a hat rack my friend!\\nRachel: Pheebs, I have to ask you\\nPhoebe: Shhhhhh! Im swamped right now.\\nRachel: Youre just staring into space.\\nPhoebe: Umm, Im trying to move that pencil.\\nRachel: This one?\\nPhoebe: It worked!\\nRachel: Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  \"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\" Its just, there is nothing! The citys full!\\nPhoebe: Wait, no, look at this!  \"Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay\" Oh, yeah, but its on the ground floor.\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nRachel: Hey.\\nRoss: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?\\nRachel: Yeah! Why?\\nRoss: Okay, theres this guy, Warren, from the museum and hes going on a dig for like two years and hes got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?\\nRachel: That sounds great! Id love to live at Warrens!! I love Warren! Thank you!\\nRoss: Dont thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Heres Warrens number.\\nRachel: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!\\nRoss: Okay, you go grab it!\\nPhoebe: I saw it.\\nRoss: I dont know what youre talking about.\\nPhoebe: Umm, Im talking about that which you already know but wont admit. You love her again; you re-love her!\\nRoss: Look, I do not re-love her.\\nPhoebe: I cant believe you wont just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you wont do anything stupid.\\nRoss: Look, were just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?\\nRachel:  Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. Im never gonna find anything.\\nRoss: You can live with me.\\nRachel: What?!\\nPhoebe: What?!\\nRoss: What?\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: Oh my God! Are you serious?!\\nRoss: Uh-huh.\\nRachel: I would love to live with you Ross; thats-thats great! Thank you!\\nRoss: Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.\\nPhoebe: Wow! Im-Im so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.\\nRachel: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! Youre my hero!\\nRoss: Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.\\nRachel: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!\\nRoss: Oh please!  Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?\\nPhoebe: No. No, I wont. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And thats how she ended up living with me!  Okay, thats a lie.\\nChandler: Hi.\\nMonica: Hi.\\nChandler: Hi, listen, Im sorry about before. I dont need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I can emNow, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women\\nMonica: Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too.\\nChandler: Really?\\nMonica: Yeah! Oh yes!\\nChandler: Ohh.\\nMonica: Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.\\nChandler: Thats a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.\\nMonica: Totally!\\nChandler: We dont have to come up with this now.\\nMonica: Oh good.\\nChandler: Hey, yknow what? Why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room?\\nMonica: Changes?\\nChandler: Yeah, I mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.\\nMonica: Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?\\nChandler: Is that a problem?\\nMonica: Well, its a set and they should probably stay together.\\nChandler: Oh, thats cool. Then Ill just bring them both over.\\nMonica: See now-now youre taking them away from their home.\\nChandler: Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!\\nMonica: Yeah-yeah, yknow what? Yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnt match! Where is it gonna go?!\\nChandler: In the game room!\\nMonica: Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!\\nChandler: All right! Thats fine! Thats fine! I wont bring over the chairs! I wont bring anything over! I wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandmas place!!\\nJoey:  Everything on your application looks really goodOhh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?\\nThe Potential Roommate: Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.\\nJoey: Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?\\nChandler:\\nJoey: Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.\\nChandler: Why did you take the shower curtain down?\\nJoey: That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.\\nRachel: Hey!\\nRoss: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.\\nRachel: Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.\\nRoss: What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?\\nRachel: No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.\\nRoss: What?! Over a stupid room!\\nRachel: Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!\\nRoss: Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!\\nRoss: Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!\\nMonica: Ross, we can handle this.\\nRoss: Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!\\nChandler: Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!\\nRoss:  Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?\\nChandler: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.\\nMonica: Love is the best medicine.\\nChandler: Thats laughter.\\nMonica: Why do you do it?\\nChandler: I dont know.\\nRoss: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?\\nChandler: Yeah, I do.\\nRoss: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?\\nMonica: Yes.\\nRoss:\\nGunther: So I understand youre looking for a place.\\nRachel: No-no, Im staying put.\\nGunther: Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.\\nRachel: Why, where are you going?\\nGunther: I dont know.\\nRoss:  Hey Rach!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nRoss: Youre never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. Thats great news rightI mean for them. Right?\\nRachel: Oh wow.\\nRoss: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.\\nRachel: Yeah. Yknow umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but dont you think its gonna be weird?\\nRoss: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?\\nRachel: Well, because of us! Because of our history.\\nRoss: No!\\nRachel: No?\\nRoss: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?\\nRachel: No! Not at all!\\nRoss: Good! Me neither! So its not a problem. Were just two friends who happen to be roommates.\\nRachel: Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.\\nRoss: Really?! We are?\\nRachel: Yeah! Im gonna have a boyfriend, youre gonna have a girlfriend\\nRoss: Ohh! That would be great.\\nRachel: But yknow what, if you think its gonna be okay well just work out a system. Yknow, itll be like college, Ill hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, \"Come back later, Im gettin lucky.\"\\nRoss:  Yeah, I didnt think of that.\\nRoss: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean its a really big step! And-and whats the rush?!\\nMonica: Thats very funny!\\nChandler: Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!\\nRoss: No, I-I-Im serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing yknow you break up!\\nMonica: Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.\\nRoss: Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnt about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!\\nChandler: Yeah, I\\'m not so worried.\\nMonica: Yeah, no, me neither.\\nRoss: Fine! Its your life!\\nMonica: You still want to move in together right?\\nChandler: Of course!\\nMonica: Ross didnt scare you?\\nChandler: Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.\\nMonica: Come here, I want to show you something!\\nChandler: Okay!\\nChandler: Oh my God! Someones killed Square Man!\\nMonica: This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen.\\nChandler: Oh thats so sweet! I want to show you something too!\\nMonica: Okay!\\nChandler: Yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say \"Merge?\"\\nMonica: Uh-hmm.\\nChandler: Yknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thats you and I together! Merge!\\nMonica: Oh my God! I love that!\\nChandler: Really?!\\nMonica: Uh, no!!\\nPhoebe:  I found you in my bed!   Howd you whined up there?   You are a mystery!  Little black curly hair!  Little black curly hair!

Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it youre right where you dont want to be! Back together!\\nRoss: Ehh, I dont, I dont think so.

Now, is that what you want?\\nRoss: Is that what I want?\\nPhoebe:  Yes.\\nJoey: Here she comes. Hold on, Im gonna make your life much easier.\\nRachel: All right, well the place was closed.

Hey did anybody lose their keys?\\nMonica: Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?\\nJoey: Theres a lost and found?\\nChandler: You left a shoe here?!\\nJoey: Well, I didnt realize until I got home. I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Yknow what? Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.\\nChandler: Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.\\nJoey: Great!

Okay, see ya!\\nChandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?\\nPhoebe:  Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and Im nervous cause Ive never done that before by myself!\\nMonica: Dont worry about it Phoebe, well absolutely do it.\\nChandler: Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.\\nMonica: Come on Chandler, come on! Itll give us great practice for whenpeople with babies come to visit.\\nGuy #1: Nice car!\\nJoey: Yeah, its not mine.\\nWoman:  I love your car.\\nJoey: Yeah, its  mine.\\nWoman: I bet its fast.\\nJoey: Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?\\nWoman: Yeah!\\nJoey:  Its got em!\\nRachel: So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Rosss, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.\\nPhoebe: What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I dont have a roommate.\\nRachel: Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.\\nPhoebe: Maybe you could be my roommate!\\nRachel: Well theres an idea!!\\nPhoebe: Yeah!\\nRachel: That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?\\nPhoebe: Umm, she said shed be back December 26th.\\nRachel: December 26th, huh maybe shes Santa Clause.\\nRachel:  Oh look who it is, my husband.

I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?\\nMonica: Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.\\nChandler: Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.\\nPhoebe: Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.\\nChandler: See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.\\nMonica: What do you mean?\\nChandler: I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around\\nPhoebe: That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.\\nChandler: Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.\\nMonica: This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.\\nPhoebe: Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.\\nJoey:  Hey guys!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nJoey: Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche Ive got the keys too, still there!\\nChandler: Shocking! Since you still have the keys.\\nJoey: You should see the treatment I get when Im with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.\\nChandler: What equity investments?\\nJoey: The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to think that I dont own it. So I figured Ill wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?\\nMonica: Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.\\nChandler: You dont even have a car!\\nMonica: I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.\\nChandler: And?\\nMonica: And six others.\\nChandler: There you are.\\nJoey: Yeah, she tops out at 130.\\nGuy #2: Wow!\\nJoey: And thats just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.\\nGuy #2: Really! You got a place upstate?\\nJoey: Sure!\\nGuy #2: Well, Ill see you later.\\nJoey: Okay, take it easy.\\nThe Porsche Owner: Hey! Thats my car.\\nJoey: Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.\\nThe Porsche Owner: What-what are you doing?\\nJoey: Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now Im just polishing her up.\\nThe Porsche Owner: But its my car!\\nJoey: Yeah, but its my wax.\\nThe Porsche Owner: Listen, I-I-I dont come to this city much so I dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.\\nJoey: Sure. Here.  Ill uh, save your parking spot.\\nThe Porsche Owner: Im not coming back.\\nJoey: Why not?\\nThe Porsche Owner: I live upstate.\\nJoey: Yeah, so did I.\\nPhoebe: I dont know why I was so nervous about this. And I dont know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.\\nMonica: Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.\\nChandler:\\nMonica: Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out!\\nChandler: He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!\\nPhoebe: No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.\\nChandler: Theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!\\nPhoebe: What?!\\nChandler: Glass, sand, whatever.\\nPhoebe: Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.\\nMonica: Oh its so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I can still do that.\\nMonica: How are you still single?!\\nChandler:  I thought about it and maybe youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.\\nMonica: Good. What made you change your mind?\\nChandler: I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.\\nPhoebe: How did that happen?!!\\nChandler: Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat.\\nMonica: Damnit! Yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!\\nJudge: Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?\\nRachel: Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.\\nJudge: So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.\\nRoss: Fine, Im mentally unstable.\\nJudge: And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.\\nRoss: What?!\\nRachel: Uh yes, heroin and crack.\\nRoss: Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!\\nRachel: Well, you would know.\\nJudge: Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?\\nRoss: Oh, come on!\\nRachel:  Ross, please, I found the magazines!\\nJudge: And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin.\\nRoss: Okay, Im sorry, this is insane! I-I-Im not addicted to heroin, Im not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, Ill consummate this marriage right here, right now!\\nJudge: That wont be necessary.\\nRoss: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!\\nRachel: Ugh!\\nJudge: Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.\\nRachel: Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike \"Consummated like bunnies\" from the record?\\nJudge: Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?\\nRachel: Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.\\nJudge: Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment. If you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce.\\nRoss:  Thats great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!\\nRachel:  What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!\\nRoss: And what Stop typing! Stop typing!!\\nRachel:  Okay, do you see, do you see what youre keeping me married too?!\\nJudge: You need to get out of my chambers.\\nRachel: All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nJudge: Would you like to spend the night in jail?\\nRachel: And thank you for your time.\\nCommercial Break\\nJoey:  So the Porsche guy took his car back.\\nChandler: But you found the keys to his clothes?\\nJoey: No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.\\nMonica: And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?\\nJoey: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?\\nChandler: That is true.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.\\nJoey: Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.\\nMonica: Joey, you know you dont actually have one.\\nJoey: Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!\\nChandler: Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.\\nMonica: All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.\\nPhoebe: What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting!\\nMonica: The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!\\nPhoebe: But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!\\nMonica: Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.\\nPhoebe: But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.\\nChandler: I think thats gum.\\nPhoebe: Im pretty sure its gun.\\nChandler: Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.\\nPhoebe: A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!\\nJoey: Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche?\\nPasserby: Maybe because youve got the keys?\\nJoey:  Porsche.\\nRachel: This is totally your fault!\\nRoss: My fault?! You threatened the judge!\\nRachel: Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!\\nRoss: That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!\\nJoey: Hi! How are the Gellers?\\nRachel: Dont call us that!\\nRoss: The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?\\nJoey: Hey! Its Porsche!!\\nPhoebe: Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, \"Yeah, I do!\" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.\\nChandler:  Hey!\\nPhoebe:  How do you feel?\\nChandler: Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.\\nPhoebe: Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.\\nChandler: And protected them from a tornado?\\nMonica: Oh my God.\\nPhoebe: I know, the babies are asleep.\\nMonica: Phoebe, what, what happened here?!\\nPhoebe: I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!\\nMonica: But my apartment!\\nChandler: Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.\\nMonica: But the mess!\\nChandler: Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.\\nMonica: Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!\\nChandler:  Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!\\nRachel:  Oh honey thank God youre home, I was getting worried.\\nRoss: I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, Ive already signed everything and I put little Xs where you need to sign.\\nRachel: Oh, little Xs! Great! That makes up for everything!\\nRoss: Yknow, I-Iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?\\nRachel: Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!\\nRoss: Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!\\nRachel: Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!\\nRoss: Yeah! Right!\\nRoss: Youre right. Thats very different. So lets, lets just sign the papers. All right?  What?\\nRachel: Nothing.\\nRoss: Okay, can we just sign please?\\nRachel: Uh-hmm.\\nRoss: Congratulations.\\nRachel: Okay Ross, werewait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Well, yknow this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.\\nRoss: Excuse me?\\nRachel: Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?\\nRoss: Yeah?\\nRachel: And uh, yeah, I didnt really, I didnt want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.\\nRoss: So then if-ifI mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.\\nRachel: Yeah, dont push it though.\\nRoss: Ive got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.\\nRachel: I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldnt be a secret, and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.\\nRoss: Did I, did I even treat?\\nRachel: No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.\\nRoss: That may be the most depressing thing Ive heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyers office.\\nRachel: Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.\\nRoss: Eh, no problem.\\nRachel: Im gonna need a copy of those.\\nRoss: Totally.\\nEnding Credits\\nJoey: Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!\\nWoman:  Hi Joey.\\nJoey: Hey! How you doin?\\nWoman:  He has the most amazing Porsche under there!\\nJoey: Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.

Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.\\nMonica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"\\nRachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.\\nPhoebe: Hey you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore.\\nMonica and Rachel: What?!\\nPhoebe: Youre just so mean to each other! And I dont want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!\\nRachel: Well, Phoebe thats fine because Im not moving.\\nMonica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her!

Like what Monica?\\nMonica: Yknow she has 147,000 pairs of boots\\nRachel: Oh yeah, good start Mon.\\nMonica: She lets you borrow them.\\nRachel: Yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet.\\nMonica: Do you wanna live outside?! Because its gettin cold!  She gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that Id like.\\nPhoebe: What else?\\nMonica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.\\nRachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.\\nPhoebe: Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.\\nMonica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.\\nRachel: Well yknow, I dont want you to be cold.\\nMonica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.\\nRachel: Oh, its gonna be fine.\\nPhoebe: Okay Rachel, I cant wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! Well have so much fun!!\\nRachel: But honey, I think shes moving in with Chandler.\\nPhoebe: Oh thats right. Youre still set on that?\\nMonica: Kinda.  Oh my God!\\nRoss:  Yeah, its a pumpkin. Ill come pack.\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Whats wrong?\\nJoey: Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!\\nChandler: Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!\\nJoey: The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt even get half a cup! Nothin!!\\nChandler: Oh man!!\\nJoey: And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I think beginners luck, very important in Cups.\\nChandler: All right, lets play one more hand! One more!\\nJoey: No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! Im serious this time! In-in fact, look, theres aI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yknow, thank you for being such a great roommate.\\nChandler: I cant take the big white dog! You love it!\\nJoey: Its him, not it!\\nChandler: No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?\\nJoey: Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here! You-youre trying to give me money again!\\nChandler: When did I try to give you money?\\nJoey: Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said \"No,\" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!\\nChandler: Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youre okay.\\nJoey: I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I cant take care of myself. Okay? Look, Im not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that Im gonna missis you. And now the dog.\\nMonica: Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?\\nRachel: Okay.\\nMonica: Im really gonna miss you.\\nRachel: Oh! I have your key. Here you go.\\nMonica: Thanks.\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nRachel: Oh God! This is silly, Im gonna see you in a couple of hours!\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nRachel: Bye house!\\nRachel: Bye Mon.\\nMonica: Bye.\\nChandler:  Hey.\\nMonica: She really left.\\nChandler: I know.\\nMonica: Thank you.\\nChandler: No problem roomie.\\nMonica: Can I ask you a question?\\nChandler: Sure!\\nMonica: What the hell is that dog doing here?!\\nEnding Credits\\nChandler: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.\\nRoss: And now you want that money back.\\nChandler: Exactly.\\nRoss: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?\\nChandler: Its not a real game! I made it up!\\nRoss: Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.\\nChandler: At a fake game!!\\nRoss: Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, Id be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.\\nChandler: Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.\\nRoss: No.\\nChandler: Hmm, lets see if it comes up this time.\\nEnd\\n======== 06-07\\nWritten by: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Plummer Transcribed by: Kiza Abuzahra With Minor Adjustments by: Eric Aasen\\nPhoebe: Ready?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nRachel: Hi...\\nPhoebe: it\\'s...\\nRachel: Rachel...\\nPhoebe: and\\nRachel: Phoebes...\\nPhoebe: please...\\nRachel: leave...\\nPhoebe: leave\\nRachel: Wait, I-I just said \"leave.\"\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know because you have all the good words.

By the year 2030, there\\'ll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.\\nChandler:  And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.\\nMonica: Hey!\\nRoss and Chandler: Hey!\\nMonica:  Honey, that\\'s a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!\\nChandler: I didn\\'t nail the boxes to the floor.\\nMonica: Oh, So you can move them!\\nChandler: Yes, and while I\\'m doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.\\nJoey: Hey everybody!

I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can\\'t date her.\\nChandler: All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?\\nJoey: Oh God, yeah.\\nChandler: Now imagine you live at the supermarket.\\nJoey:  Okay!\\nChandler: No-no\\nJoey: Oh, Oh, you\\'re right! I don\\'t want that. I can\\'t date her!\\nMonica: Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.\\nJoey: Well, that\\'s gonna be tough Mon. I mean it\\'s hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.\\nMonica:  Hmm, well you\\'re around me all the time and you don\\'t flirt.\\nJoey: You a little sad about that sweetheart?\\nPhoebe: I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I\\'ll catch up.\\nRachel: Okay.\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nRachel: You guys, I\\'m telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.\\nRoss: Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.\\nRachel: Oh! I used to do that too!\\nMonica: Did you also have his album, It\\'s Not Easy Being Green?\\nRachel: Aw, Mon...\\nMonica: So, Phoebe runs weird huh?\\nRachel: Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she\\'s gonna wanna run again, I just don\\'t know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.\\nMonica: Why don\\'t you just be straight with her?

Hey, hey, the place looks great!\\nChandler: Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monicas gonna be working late, so I\\'m gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I\\'m gonna do, know what else I\\'m gonna do? I\\'m gonna go downstairs, I\\'m gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn\\'t wanna live with me?\\nJoey:  I don\\'t! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.\\nChandler: Yeah, now how\\'s that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?\\nJoey: Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it\\'s tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don\\'t know how to get rid of it.  How you doin?\\nJoey:  Ohhhh man\\nJanine: Sorry, there\\'s just more room out here.\\nJoey: No-no-no-no-no, it\\'s-it\\'s uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.\\nJanine:  Why don\\'t you try to do-\\nJoey:\\nJanine: What\\'s wrong?\\nJoey: Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn\\'t want you to touch me cause I\\'m -I\\'m all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower.  Oh my God!\\nJanine: Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It\\'s just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.\\nPhoebe:  Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it\\'s me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.\\nRachel: No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!\\nPhoebe: Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.\\nRachel: No, wait Phoebe.\\nRoss:  Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?\\nChandler: What does it look like I\\'m doing? I am cleaning!\\nRoss: Did you get Monica\\'s authorization to move all of her stuff?\\nChandler: Authorization? I don\\'t need that. I\\'m gonna put everything back.\\nRoss: Put it back exactly where you found it?\\nChandler: Yes I\\'m gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.\\nRoss: Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.\\nChandler: She\\'s not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.\\nRoss: Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?\\nChandler: She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.\\nRoss: Hmm -you know, actually this\\'ll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey\\'s hot new roommate can come and live with me.\\nChandler: I see, I see, y-y-you\\'re trying to freak me out.\\nRoss: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakout. Oh my God, she\\'s going to sit on you.\\nChandler: No, she\\'s not okay? And I\\'ll prove it to you. I\\'m gonna call her right now.  Phone\\'s done ehh.\\nMonica:  Hi!\\nChandler: Hey Mon, how\\'s it going?\\nMonica: Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.\\nChandler: Oh come on, come on, it can\\'t be that bad.\\nMonica: It\\'s worse. The only thing that\\'s getting me through is knowing that I\\'m gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.\\nChandler: No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.\\nMonica: Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?\\nChandler: It\\'s, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She\\'s-she\\'s gonna kill me.\\nRoss: Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.\\nCommercial Break\\nChandler: We should start with the big stuff. Yknow? That\\'ll be the easiest. Uh, let\\'s start with the couch.\\nRoss: Yeah that-that, doesn\\'t look right.\\nChandler: What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here\\'s what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.\\nRoss: Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won\\'t line up with he back of the carpet.\\nChandler: OK well here, we\\'ll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.\\nRoss: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won\\'t be centered in the seating area.\\nChandler: Yes, but the coffee table doesn\\'t match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!\\nJoey:  Monica\\'s gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.\\nRoss: Hey, I\\'ve been married 3 times\\nJoey: No-no-no I\\'ve seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What\\'s your secret?\\nRoss: Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.\\nChandler: Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?\\nRoss: Yeah, well what about you? You weren\\'t you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he\\'d go \"ba dum bum chessh\"\\nChandler: Yeah, Monica doesn\\'t like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.\\nRoss: Oh y\\'know what, girls don\\'t like it when I start talking about science.\\nChandler: That\\'s not specific to girls.\\nJoey: This is great, this is great, what else, what else?\\nRoss: Uh, they don\\'t like it when you correct their grammar.\\nChandler: And they don\\'t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.\\nRoss: They don\\'t like it when you keep asking them if they like you.\\nChandler: Man, I\\'m so lucky I have Monica.\\nRoss:  I\\'m never gonna find love again.\\nRachel: Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?\\nPhoebe: Sure\\nRachel: Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I\\'m sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.\\nPhoebe: So, what should you have done?\\nRachel: Well, I-I should\\'ve told you the truth.\\nPhoebe: Uh-Huh, Which is...?\\nRachel: Well, y\\'know, the reason I didn\\'t wanna go running with you is because um, well y\\'know the way that you run is a little...\\nPhoebe: So?\\nRachel: Well, it\\'s embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.\\nPhoebe: Why do you care?\\nRachel: Because they\\'re people.\\nPhoebe: But people that you don\\'t know and will never see again.\\nRachel: Yes, but still. They\\'re peoplewith eyes.\\nPhoebe: Well, I didn\\'t get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You\\'re uptight.\\nRachel: I-I am not uptightHey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.\\nPhoebe: That\\'s okay Rachel. I\\'m not judging you; that\\'s just who you are. Me. I\\'m more free y\\'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that\\'s the only way it\\'s fun. Y\\'know, I mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y\\'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor\\'s dog.\\nChandler: Okay, is this lamp in the same place?\\nRoss: Who cares? I repel women.\\nChandler:  No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can\\'t come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.\\nMonica: What?!\\nRoss:  What?!\\nChandler:  I couldn\\'t say that I was naked because she\\'s allowed too see me naked.\\nRoss: Why does anyone have to be naked?\\nMonica: Why is Ross naked?\\nRoss: I-I had to show Chandler something?\\nMonica: Naked?\\nRoss: Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.\\nMonica: Is it the same thing that Chandler had?\\nChandler: Look, uh, just come later, we\\'ll get everything squared away and you can come back later.\\nMonica: Okay, listen, there\\'s still some of Chandler\\'s medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!\\nChandler: Bye! Thank God\\nRoss: Dude, what\\'d you have?\\nChandler: Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.\\nRoss:  The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.\\nChandler: That\\'s perfect! That\\'s brilliant!\\nRoss: So really, what\\'d ya have?\\nJanine: Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.\\nJoey: Uh, don\\'t you mean \"for whom?\"\\nJanine: Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?\\nJoey: Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.\\nJanine: Is there something wrong?\\nJoey: All right, All right, let\\'s just get this out in the open okay? You\\'re hot. I\\'m lovable. Clearly there\\'s a vibe going on between us. But, we\\'re roommates and it\\'s a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.\\nJanine: Joey...\\nJoey: No, no, no, I\\'m telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?\\nJanine: Well, I don\\'t think there is anything to do. I mean I think you\\'re really sweet, but I\\'m just not interested in you like that.\\nJoey: Oh!\\nJanine: No! I mean you\\'re a really nice guy and I\\'m happy to be your roommate and your friend, I\\'m just y\\'know, I just don\\'t feel that way about you.\\nJoey: Oh! I see what happened. It\\'s because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you\\'d feel a lot different if I turned it on.\\nJanine: I don\\'t think so.\\nJoey: Oh, I do.  How you doin?\\nJanine: I\\'m OK\\nJoey: What?!?!\\nJanine: What?\\nJoey: Oh dear God!\\nRachel:  Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nRachel: Oh honey, I\\'m so sorry, you were right, this feels great!\\nPhoebe: See? And you don\\'t care if people are staring, it\\'s just for a second cause then you\\'re gone!\\nRachel: Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful.\\nMonica: Is it okay for me to come in now?\\nChandler: Uh-huh\\nMonica: Why is everything different?\\nRoss: Bye!\\nChandler: No, I don\\'t see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.\\nMonica: Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don\\'t even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.\\nChandler: Okay look, don\\'t...don\\'t be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I\\'m sorry, I\\'m very sorry, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.\\nMonica: It\\'s okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?\\nChandler: Do you want me to be afraid of you?\\nMonica: Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it\\'s, it\\'s a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I\\'d never expect you to worry about that.\\nChandler: Really?\\nMonica: Of course!\\nChandler: Oh well you\\'re the best. You come here to me.\\nMonica: All right, hold on okay? First thing\\'s first.  Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?\\nClosing Credits\\nRoss: So it said that by the year 2030, there\\'ll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...\\nJanine: ...and live forever as a machine!\\nRoss: That\\'s so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we\\'re doing right now? You and I, we\\'re interfacing.\\nJanine: Yeah, I gotta go.\\nChandler: Ba dum bumb cheshhh!\\nEnd\\n======== 06-08\\nWritten by: Perry Rein and Gigi McCreey Transcribed by: Aaron D.

Well, it turns out thats not true.\\nKim: Thats not true?\\nRachel: No.\\nKim: Oh thats interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.\\nRachel: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.\\nKim: Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.\\nRachel: I-I dont want your job. I-I dont.

I dont even know how to use my keycard.\\nKim: Hi Ralph.\\nRalph Lauren:: Hi Kim.\\nKim: Yeah, nothing happen.

Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, lets talk more about you. Hmm.\\nJoey: So whats really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.\\nMonica: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.\\nChandler: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.\\nMonica: Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because Im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.\\nJoey: Ohh, I love birds.\\nChandler: What is the matter with you ?!?\\nJoey: What?\\nChandler: Youre arranging flowers!

Its the way you said it.Oh My God, Im a women!!!\\nRachel: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.\\nPhoebe: But why didnt you just tell her the truth.\\nRachel: I did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.\\nPhoebe: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?\\nRachel: You were with Kenny today, werent you?\\nPhoebe: Just for a second.\\nRachel: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?\\nPhoebe: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.\\nRachel: Im not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldnt.\\nPhoebe: Ohh, sleep with Kenny.\\nRachel: That wouldnt help me.\\nPhoebe: Ohh, yes it would.\\nHillary: Ive had a really good time tonight.\\nRoss: Mmm.\\nHillary: You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.\\nRoss:\\nHillary: Are you going to eat that bread?\\nRoss:  Mmmm.\\nHillary:  You make me laugh.\\nRoss: Hmm-Hmm.\\nHillary: Would you like to move over to the couch?\\nRoss: Mmm-Hmm.\\nHillary: Maybe Ill just turn the lights down a little.\\nRoss:  How about all the way.\\nHillary: Okay.\\nRoss:  So, ahh, where were we?\\nHillary: Are those your teeth??\\nRoss: Ohh, you can see them, huh?\\nHillary: Yes.

Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I cant do this. Im married and Im sorry.\" And then I dont know why but he said, \"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.\"\\nKim: You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.\\nRalph Lauren:: Hi Kim.\\nKim: Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. Its like he hates you. Then it is true.\\nRachel: Of course its true and it hurts so bad.\\nKim: Ohh honey come here.  Ohh it will be ok.

Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.\\nRachel: Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?\\nPhoebe: I dunno, lets see!

Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death.

But if she says Dude, what the hell are you doing?

So it wasnt as bad as-as\\nPaul: Ross, look, I know Ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its partly because Im very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many,  all bad.\\nRoss: Not all bad.\\nPaul: And anyhow, Im sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I  still look at Lizzie like shes a twelve-year-old girl.\\nRoss: Yeah.

I wanna make sure its perfect.\\nPhoebe: Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose.

Yeah.\\nChandler: This is terrible. What am I going to do?\\nPhoebe: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.\\nChandler: Thats right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.\\nPhoebe: Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! Convince her that youre a little coward!\\nChandler: I can do that, Ive had 30 years of practice.\\nJoey: Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!\\nMonica:  I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!\\nJoey: That guys still doing that?!\\nRachel:  Oh my God youre here, let me see your hand!!\\nPhoebe: No, youre too late!!!

Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?\\nJoey: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.\\nMonica:  Hi guys!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nMonica: What are you up too?\\nChandler: Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.\\nJoey:  Yeah, Big Brother.\\nMonica: Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.\\nChandler: Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?\\nMonica: Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!\\nChandler: Eh\\nMonica: Okay well thats good to know.\\nJoey:\\nWaitress: Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?\\nMonica: Sure, I love this part!\\nWaitress:  Come on in.\\nRichard: Hi!\\nMonica: Richard!\\nRichard: Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.\\nMonica: Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So whats up?\\nRichard: Well, it was great seeing you the other night.\\nMonica: Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?\\nRichard: No! I came here to tell you something else.  to tell you I still love you.\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: What uhWhat did youWhat?!\\nRichard: I still love you. And I know I probably shouldnt even be here telling you this, I mean youre with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say hes straight Ill believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didnt tell ya Id regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.\\nMonica: Yknow youre really not supposed to be back here!\\nRichard: Well yeah, Im sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.\\nMonica: Oh God  Why dont they put chairs back here?!\\nRichard: I know this is crazy but am I too late?\\nMonica: What the Yes youre too late! Where was all this three years ago?!\\nRichard: Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Yknow after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!\\nMonica: What were you doing in Africa?\\nRichard: Working with blind kids.\\nMonica: Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I Im sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.\\nRichard: Okay thats fine, Ill walk away. And Ill never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandlers willing to give you everything I am.\\nMonica: Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, Im the one thats making him wait!\\nRichard: You are?\\nMonica: Yeah!\\nRichard: Why?\\nMonica: Why? Because of the government.\\nRachel: Isnt it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin married.\\nPhoebe: I know, theyre gonna be so happy together.\\nRachel: Ohh I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?\\nPhoebe: Not that often!\\nRachel: No! Im so happy for them!\\nPhoebe: Me too! So happy for them!\\nRachel: Im so happy and not at all jealous.\\nPhoebe: Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!\\nRachel: I mean Im probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean whats 2%? Thats nothing.\\nPhoebe: Totally. Im like 90/10.\\nRachel: Yeah me too.\\nJoey: Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?\\nRachel:  Whno, but yknow who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.\\nMonica: So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?\\nChandler: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!\\nMonica: Yeah, but thats pigs not people!\\nChandler: If marriage worked, Id be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.\\nMonica: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?\\nChandler: Well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.\\nMonica: Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!\\nChandler: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why dont you put down your copy of The Rules huh mantrap?!\\nMonica: Yknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh!\\nChandler:  Its okay, I got a plan.\\nRachel: Were gonna find love!\\nPhoebe: Definitely!\\nRachel: Yeah, Im pretty confident about that. Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.\\nPhoebe: What do you mean?\\nRachel: Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.\\nPhoebe: You mean a backup?\\nRachel: Exactly!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah I got that.\\nRachel: You do?\\nPhoebe: Hm-mmm.\\nRachel: Who?\\nPhoebe: Joey.\\nRachel: Joey?!\\nPhoebe: Yeah!\\nRachel: Are you serious?!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I locked him years ago!\\nRachel: Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.\\nPhoebe: Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.\\nRachel: Oh, seriously?\\nPhoebe: Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were\\nRachel: Charming.\\nPhoebe: Well hey, its just a backup.\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nJoey: Hey Monica!\\nMonica: Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?\\nJoey: This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?\\nMonica: Yeah, its great.\\nJoey: Whoa-whoa, whats the matter?! Talk to the captain!\\nMonica: Im just having one of those days where you realize youre in a dead-end relationship!\\nJoey: Chandler giving you a hard time huh?\\nMonica: Its not like I want to get married tomorrow! Its just that I-Id like to believe that Im in a relationship thats actually going somewhere, that Im not just wasting my time!\\nJoey: Well, you know Chandler.\\nMonica: No I dont know Chandler! Not anymore! Its like its like somethings changed.\\nJoey: Maybe you changed?\\nMonica: I didnt change!\\nJoey: Maybe thats the problem.\\nMonica: What?!\\nJoey: Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.\\nMonica: Is that some kind of boat talk?\\nJoey: I dont know!  I havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.\\nMonica: What does he think? Does he think Im just gonna wait around for nothing?\\nJoey: Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!\\nMonica:  Well theres some people who do want to marry me.\\nJoey: There are?\\nMonica: Yeah! Richard!\\nJoey: R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!\\nMonica: Thats right.\\nJoey: Chandler loves marriage!!\\nMonica: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! That-that hes against marriage and always will be!\\nJoey: You got that from what I said?!\\nNarrator: When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.\\nRoss: What happened you guys?\\nRoss: Rach!\\nRachel: Hey you!\\nRoss: Hey, come on in.\\nRachel: Oh thank you. Hey yknow, Im so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.\\nRoss: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought wed be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasnt meant to be.\\nRachel: Yeah, love. Its a tricky business isnt it?\\nRoss: I guess so.\\nRachel: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time were 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and weve-weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, \"Whats that?!\"\\nRoss: Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.\\nRachel: Exactly.\\nRoss: Ohh, yeah I already have one.\\nRachel: What? Who?\\nRoss: Phoebe.\\nRachel: Phoebe?! Wait abut-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.\\nRoss: Ohh, I dont think so.\\nRachel: Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!\\nRoss: Thats impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.\\nJoey: Where the hell have you been?!\\nChandler: I was making a coconut phone with the professor.\\nJoey: Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!\\nChandler: What?!\\nJoey: Yeah! Yeah, Ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off!\\nChandler: MyOh my God!\\nJoey: I know! They suck!!\\nChandler: Hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! Im supposed to do that!\\nJoey: I know!\\nChandler: Well what Yknow what Im gonna do? Im gonna go over there; Im gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!\\nJoey: Look, Chandler I dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!\\nChandler: Youre right.\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nChandler: Okay.  Im just going to propose!\\nJoey: Okay.\\nChandler: Okay great.\\nJoey: Dude-dude-dude!\\nChandler: What?!\\nJoey: Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: Hi.\\nRichard: Hi.\\nMonica: I dont know why Im here.\\nRichard: I didnt ask.

Well, Ill just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.\\nMonica:  Chandler is such an idiot!\\nRichard:  Drink?\\nMonica: Yeah, Ill have a scotch\\nRichard: on the rocks with a twist? I remember.\\nMonica:  Still smoking cigars?\\nRichard: Uh, no! No! Thatsart! If it bothers you I can put my art out.\\nMonica: No thats, thats okay.\\nRichard: So Monica let me ask you a question. Yknow, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?\\nMonica: Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.\\nRichard: Oh really?\\nMonica: Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I dont like my new eye doctor.\\nRichard: Who is it?\\nMonica: Edward Nevski?\\nRichard: Yeah hes no good. Do you ever  non-eye doctor way?\\nMonica: No.\\nRichard: Ahh.\\nMonica: But getting over was the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.\\nRachel: Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!\\nPhoebe: Of course I can! Its just good sense to backup your backup! Look, Ive already lost Chandler!\\nRachel: What?!\\nJoey:  Hey!\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nJoey: Phoebe!

Talking about pig sex over lunch, I dont want that!\\nRichard: I think thats fair.\\nMonica: Fair? Please dont even talk to me about fair! Fair wouldve been you wanting to marry me back then!

We didnt think hed ever propose!\\nChandler: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.\\nMonica: I cant believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!\\nMrs. Geller: We might still have some money, if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.\\nMr. Geller: It seemed like such a simple idea.\\nMrs. Geller: Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.\\nMr. Geller: All right, enough! I dont want to hear about it anymore!\\nRoss: Okay! Now, Im going to touch you.\\nMonica: I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?\\nChandler: I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce.

No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!\\nRachel: No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.\\nChandler: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.\\nRachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!\\nPhoebe: Look, why dont you just pay for it yourself?\\nMonica: How? I dont have any money.\\nChandler: Well, I have some.\\nMonica: How much?\\nChandler: Well, close to\\nMonica: Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!\\nRachel: Well what?!

How could you do that to an old man?!\\nRoss:  Im sorry?\\nPhoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.\\nRoss:  I gave him an extremely professional massage!\\nPhoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.\\nRoss: Okay, so it wasnt uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.\\nPhoebe: Well, hes never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!\\nRoss: Hey, yknow what? This is your fault! Youre the one that didnt move his-his appointment.\\nPhoebe: Oh, its my fault?! You didnt have to massage him! You couldve sent him away! You couldve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!\\nRoss: He said he liked that!! Oh youre right, youre right. Im sorry.\\nJoey: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?\\nRoss: His daughter was hot.\\nJoey: Gotcha.\\nMonica: Hey.\\nChandler: Hey.\\nMonica: Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.\\nChandler: Ehh.\\nMonica: Eh, you work for that.\\nChandler: Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.\\nMonica: You do?!\\nChandler: Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.\\nMonica: Oh, youre so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?\\nChandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\\nMonica: You thought about that?\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nMonica: How many kids were we gonna have?\\nChandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\\nMonica: What else did you think about?\\nChandler: Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow?

He does that every week too.\\nMonica: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nMonica: He hates to lose.\\nChandler: Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.\\nRoss: Youre not a lefty?\\nChandler: Does anybody know me?!\\nMonica: Whats wrong Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!\\nMonica: No!! Why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!\\nPhoebe:  Because Im normal!

Lets start sailing, and I want to go over there  Yo-ho-ho!\\nRachel: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, lets do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  whats this called?\\nJoey: Uh, boat rope.\\nRachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?\\nJoey: Uhh, rub it?\\nRachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?\\nJoey: Id say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh\\nRachel: Times up, now your dead.\\nJoey: And deaf!\\nRachel: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!\\nJoey: Yes.\\nRachel: Dont just say yes! This isnt a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!\\nJoey: I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.\\nMonica: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.\\nPhoebe: You do?\\nMonica: You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.\\nPhoebe: That and arrogance.\\nJoey:  Hey.\\nMonica: Hey! How was sailing?\\nJoey: I dont want to talk about it. Yknow, you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie.\\nMonica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!\\nJoey:\\nPhoebe: I cant believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.\\nRoss:  Hey.\\nMonica: Hey! How was it?\\nRoss: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand\\nChandler: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.\\nRoss: And what did he ask you not to call him?\\nChandler: Daddy. All right look, heres the story.  So I take off my glasses and thats when in happened.\\nChandler: Guys?\\nRoss: Over here.\\nMr. Geller: Have a seat son.\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!\\nChandler: I know.\\nMonica: You gave my father a lap dance!\\nChandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!\\nRoss: Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.\\nChandler: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?\\nPhoebe: Come on, its not that big a deal!\\nChandler: Not that big a deal? Therethere was touching of things.\\nRoss: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?\\nMonica: Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!\\nChandler: I dont want him to tell this story for years.\\nRoss: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.\\nMonica: I wasnt escaping.\\nRoss: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?\\nMonica: I was trying to help out a squirrel.\\nRoss: You were trying to eat it!\\nChandler: If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!\\nMonica:\\nChandler:  All right, Im off to see your dad.\\nRoss: Whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?\\nRachel:  Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.\\nChandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass.\\nRoss:  Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?\\nRachel: I dont know. Yknow, they didnt get us anything.\\nRoss: Thank you!\\nJoey:  Hey.\\nRoss: Hey.\\nRachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettin back out on the water matey?\\nJoey: Oh uh, I dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!\\nRachel: Why not?\\nJoey: Because! Youre mean on the boat!\\nRachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.\\nJoey: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!\\nRoss: Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all.\\nRachel: Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldnt move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.\\nRoss: You have to respect the sea!\\nRachel: Look Joey, Im sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.\\nJoey: Does a good teacher say, \"Put down the beer pinhead!?\"\\nRachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?\\nJoey: Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?\\nRachel: Yeah, I didnt want you to get hit by the boom!\\nJoey: Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.\\nRachel: All right, yknow what? I-Im sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.\\nJoey: You wont boss me around anymore?\\nRachel: I wont boss you around.\\nJoey: And youll be nice?\\nRachel: And, Ill be nice.\\nJoey: And youll be topless?\\nRachel: AndJoey!\\nJoey: Do you want me to learn?!\\nMonica: Okay, heres batch 22.

Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.\\nPhoebe: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?\\nMonica: No, just a Friday night.\\nRoss: Ohh, these are pretty good.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.\\nRoss: Which one was that?\\nMonica: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.\\nRoss: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  Im okay.\\nPhoebe: Are there anymore from the good batch? Cause we could just work off of those.\\nRoss: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh\\nRachel: Okay Joey honey, youre doing really good!

Since Im here, I think Im gonna have me a little beer on the port side.\\nRachel: Okay Joey, were luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?\\nJoey: Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnt know there.\\nRachel: Joey, come on! We just went over this!\\nJoey: Oh, yknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!\\nRachel:  No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!\\nJoey: All right thats it! Youre yelling and I dont see you taking your top off! I quit!\\nRachel: What do you mean you quit?! You cant quit!\\nJoey: Why not?!\\nRachel: Because youre not finished yet and I wont have it! Greens do not quit!\\nJoey: Greens? Im a Tribbiani!

No! Im not yelling at you, Im just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh Im my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! Ive been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin. Oh, Joey, Im sorry. Im so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.\\nJoey: Well, hey I did learn.\\nRachel: Really?\\nJoey: Yeah! Come on.\\nRachel: Awww\\nJoey: Yeah, its okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.\\nRachel: Left.\\nJoey: Damnit!\\nPhoebe: Yknow, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that were trying to figure out her recipe. I bet shes l-l-lookin up at us and smiling right now.\\nRoss: Looking up?\\nPhoebe: Oh yeahNo, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell for sure.\\nMonica: Well, Ive tried everything. I give up. I guess Im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.\\nRoss: Aww, Pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?\\nPhoebe: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And thats not happening til October 15th, 2032.\\nRoss: Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.\\nPhoebe: Thats what you think.\\nMonica: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?\\nPhoebe: Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.\\nMonica: What was her name?\\nPhoebe: Nesele Toulouse.\\nMonica: Nestle Tollhouse?!\\nPhoebe: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe:  Ohh.\\nMonica: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!\\nPhoebe: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!\\nChandler: So you understand, Id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a littleIm a little embarrassed about it.\\nMr. Geller: I understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.\\nChandler: What did you do when they found out?\\nMr. Geller: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?\\nChandler: So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!\\nEnding Credits\\nRachel: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.\\nJoey: Yeah, yeah.

How much weight could she have gained?\\nChandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.\\nMonica: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats not the point.\\nChandler: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!\\nMonica: Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.\\nChandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.\\nMonica: How?\\nChandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!\\nMonica: What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!\\nChandler: Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.\\nMonica: Keep going.\\nChandler: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.\\nMonica: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?\\nChandler: Id carry you around in my pocket.\\nMonica: I love you.\\nChandler: Skidmarks still got a way with the ladies.\\nRachel: Hi Pheebs.\\nPhoebe: Hi!\\nRachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. Im really sorry I was a baby.\\nPhoebe: Thats ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once.  Oh, you mean today.\\nRachel: Yeah. Yeah, and yknow you-you deserve to win.

Im just gonna grab a couple of these.\\nPhoebe: This stuff is great!\\nRachel: Oh, I forgot this was in here.

Yeah\\nPhoebe: Yknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicas made of honor.\\nRachel: You do? Why?\\nPhoebe: Because I think it means more to you.\\nRachel: But Pheebs, yknow you earned it.\\nPhoebe: Its fine. I mean, this is something that youve been thinking about since you were what, 14?\\nRachel: No, I was ten. I just developed early.\\nPhoebe:  Man alive!\\nMonica:  Hey, whats going on?\\nRachel: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.\\nMonica:\\nRachel: Yeah okay, you laugh now, but shes gonna be yours.\\nEnding Credits\\nJoey: Great nap.\\nRoss: It really was.\\nJoey:\\nRoss:\\nEnd\\n======== 07-07\\nWritten by: Scott Silveri Directed by: David Schwimmer Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\nJoey: Morning!\\nRachel: Hi!

See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.\\nThe Head Librarian: We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I cant help you.\\nRoss: Well, fine. Fine!

Did she see us?\\nMonica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?\\nJanice: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldnt really be alone tonight.  I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.\\nMonica:  Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arent they?\\nJanice: Please, its because otherwise I really dont know what I might do.\\nChandler: Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?\\nJanice:  Do you have any tissues?\\nMonica: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.\\nJanice: Okay!\\nMonica: Well justwell just let her stay.\\nChandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!\\nMonica: Kinda like your Barca lounger.\\nChandler: Is that what youre thinking about right now?\\nMonica: I never stop thinking about it.\\nJanice: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.\\nChandler: Janice, Im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.\\nJanice: Why not?\\nChandler: Honestly?

Happy Thanksgiving!\\nChandler: No, no, no. No-no-no.\\nJoey, Rachel, and Phoebe: Shhhh!\\nRoss: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?\\nChandler: No, we\\'re playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.\\nRoss: What? That\\'s like insanely easy!\\nChandler: Now, that\\'s a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .\\nMonica: It\\'s a stupid game and I wasn\\'t playing against other people, so technically I didn\\'t lose.\\nRoss: What? You forgot fourteen states?\\nMonica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas.\\nChandler: Oh, okay, time\\'s up!\\nRachel: All right, I got 48.\\nChandler: Oh that\\'s not bad, Pheebs?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.\\nChandler: Okay, so Rachel\\'s got 48 and Phoebe has the lead invegetables, Joey?\\nJoey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler\\'s dumb states game.\\nRoss: Wow, how many have you got?\\nJoey: Fifty-six!\\nOpening Credits\\nJoey: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!\\nChandler: Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.\\nRachel:  How come we have one extra place setting?\\nMonica: \\'Cause you invited your assistant.\\nRachel: Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag\\'s not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he\\'s spending Thanksgiving with her.\\nMonica: Oh! Why didn\\'t you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.\\nRachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you\\'re food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.\\nMonica: Now you think I wouldn\\'t enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.\\nPhoebe: Regular Celery!\\nRoss: Done! With time a-to-spare.\\nChandler: Oooh that may be a New World\\'s record\\nRoss: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it\\'s kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can\\'t name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called \"a globe?\" Hmm?\\nChandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.\\nRoss: What? That\\'s impossible.\\nJoey: 46. Wow! Who\\'s well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?\\nMonica: All right, I\\'m out of oven space. I\\'m gonna turn on Joey\\'s. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!\\nChandler: I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!\\nRoss: No, just give me another minute.\\nChandler: Look Ross, if you don\\'t know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.\\nRoss: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.\\nChandler: Okay, but if you can\\'tno dinner!\\nRoss: You\\'re on!\\nJoey:  All right. Don\\'t look at my list, Ross, \\'cause there\\'s a lot on there that you don\\'t have.\\nMonica:  Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn\\'t work?\\nJoey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?\\nMonica: Ross, I\\'m gonna use yours, okay?\\nRoss: Pshhshhh!\\nMonica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand?\\nChandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.\\nJoey: Don\\'t worry, Chandler, it\\'s not a globe of the United States.\\nPhoebe: Hey you guys I\\'m gonna go out and take a walk.\\nRoss: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?\\nPhoebe: Oh, it\\'s not!\\nRachel: Seriously, it\\'s moving!\\nJoey: What the hell is in there?\\nPhoebe: It\\'s just my knitting that\\'s all!  Yes! I knit this. I\\'m very good.\\nMonica: Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don\\'t hang out here more often?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know. Maybe it\\'s because it smells a little weird. It\\'s like old pumpkins or something.\\nMonica: That\\'s my pie!\\nChandler: Which smells delicious!\\nMonica: Uh-oh! Uh-oh!\\nChandler: What?\\nMonica: We left Joey alone with the food!  Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!\\nPhoebe:  Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?\\nMonica: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry, who\\'s this?\\nMonica: Phoebe, there\\'s a dog sitting on my couch!\\nChandler: Tell her, I\\'m allergic, and I will sue!\\nPhoebe: No, there\\'s no dog here?\\nMonica: Yes there is! He\\'s black and white and shaggy and  he\\'s sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel\\'s hand.\\nPhoebe: Oh my god! Where are you?\\nMonica: I\\'ll be right there!\\nPhoebe:  They\\'re here already? How are they doing this?\\nRachel:  Hi Tag! What are you doing here?\\nTag: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.\\nRachel: Well, sure! Come in!  Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?\\nTag: We kinda broke up this morning.\\nRachel: Oh, I\\'m sorry.\\nTag: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.\\nRoss: Ohio!! Thank you!\\nChandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!\\nRoss: What dog? There-there\\'s no dog here.\\nJoey: Yeah that dog left!\\nMonica:  Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!\\nPhoebe: There\\'s no dog in here.\\nChandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!\\nPhoebe: No that\\'s just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.\\nChandler: What is it doing here?\\nPhoebe: Well, I\\'m watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?\\nMonica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!\\nChandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I\\'m anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!\\nPhoebe: That\\'s odd, \\'cause this dog\\'s been living here for the past 3 days\\nChandler:  Really?\\nMonica: Chandler, if that dog\\'s been here that long, and you haven\\'t had a reaction, maybe you\\'re not allergic to this dog?\\nChandler: Well, it still has to go, right?\\nMonica and Phoebe: Why?\\nChandler: Okay, it\\'s um\\nJoey:  Don\\'t do it!\\nMonica: Don\\'t do what?\\nChandler:  Okay, I hate dogs.\\nAll: What?\\nPhoebe: Are you crazy?\\nRoss: Are you out of your mind?\\nPhoebe: Why?\\nJoey: Told ya.\\nChandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can\\'t tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.\\nRoss: Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!\\nRachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?\\nChandler:  Is there a puppy here?\\nTag: You don\\'t like puppies?\\nChandler:  Okay, you are new!\\nJoey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It\\'s like Ross not likin ice cream.\\nPhoebe: You don\\'t like ice cream?\\nRoss: It\\'s too cold.\\nChandler: Okay, it\\'s just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.\\nRoss:  It hurts my teeth.\\nChandler: And I don\\'t wanna say this, I don\\'t you guys to hate me, but uh, I don\\'t think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!\\nRoss: How can I not get this? I\\'m a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.\\nMonica: 1250.\\nRoss: Damn, I forgot you were here.\\nPhoebe: All right. We\\'re gonna take Clunkers to Rosss. We\\'ll be back in a minute.\\nRachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nRachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'d say about a month.\\nMonica: Really? I\\'d say 3 to 4.\\nJoey: Half hour.\\nRachel: Interesting.\\nMonica: When it\\'s your assistant, I would say never.\\nJoey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn\\'t like you, this is all a moo-point.\\nRachel: Huh. A moo-point?\\nJoey: Yeah, it\\'s like a cow\\'s opinion. It just doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s moo.\\nRachel:  Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?\\nMonica: Please, don\\'t listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-hes obviously depressed. He\\'s away from his family; he\\'s spending Thanksgiving with strangers.  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.\\nRachel: You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. Thank you. Okay, that\\'s what I\\'m gonna do.\\nJoey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what\\'s inside.\\nRachel: Hey!\\nTag: Hey.\\nRachel: How are you holding up?\\nTag: Not bad.\\nRachel: Yeah? I\\'m sorry about your girlfriend.\\nTag: Thanks.\\nRachel: So were you guys together a long time?\\nTag: A year. On and off. I kinda thought we\\'d end up together. I don\\'t anymore.\\nRachel: Now that she broke up with you?\\nTag: Yeah.\\nRachel: Yeah. Hmmmm.\\nTag: It\\'s weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it\\'s like what if it\\'s not. Do you ever have that feeling?\\nRachel: NoYeah, all the time, constantly. It\\'s terrifying. But you know that I figure itit has to work out.\\nTag: Why?\\nRachel: Because, uhit has to.\\nTag: You have all the answers, don\\'t you?\\nRachel: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.\\nTag: Hey, thanks for talking to me.\\nRachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!\\nJoey:  All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!\\nTag: What?\\nJoey:\\nCommercial Break\\nTag: What did Joey say? I like you back?\\nRachel: Uh, yeah, well, see, he Joey knows, that I\\'m-I\\'m very insecure about my back and, andyou\\'re hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!\\nTag: Wait-wait a minute; that doesn\\'t make any sense.\\nRachel: No?  All right, here\\'s the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I\\'m attracted to you.\\nTag: Wow.\\nRachel: Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that\\'s crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.\\nTag:\\nRachel: What?\\nTag: Right there! That\\'s my car!  Hey!!\\nRachel: Okay, that\\'s gonna take them a minute.

She doesn\\'t want to see you right now.\\nChandler: Why not?\\nRoss: Because you sent away the dog!\\nChandler: This is ridiculous.\\nRoss: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn\\'t like dogs. So Monica and her friendPhyllistake away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don\\'t you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.\\nJoey:  What\\'s the matter?\\nChandler: Monica\\'s all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.\\nJoey: So? Bring the dog back, you\\'re a hero.\\nChandler: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?\\nJoey: Chandler, it\\'s like a big gerbil.\\nChandler: And that doesn\\'t scare you?\\nJoey: Ross, you need some help?\\nRoss: From you?  Yes, please!\\nJoey:  First of all, Utah? Dude, you can\\'t just make stuff up!\\nRoss: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.\\nJoey: Hey!

Yknow, for you, and\\nPhoebe: We have good news, look whose back!\\nRachel:  Hi!\\nChandler: Clunkers?! Oh my god!\\nMonica: That\\'s right, she came back all by herself.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s a Thanksgiving miracle!\\nChandler:  It is so good to see you!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross\\' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in I went to far, didn\\'t I? When should I have stopped?\\nRoss: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren\\'t 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.\\nChandler: It\\'s up to you.\\nRachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing?\\nTag: I\\'m okay.

Uh, so, where did you say you\\'re from again?\\nTag: Colorado.\\nRoss: Ah, what good are you.\\nRachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.\\nTag: Okay.\\nRachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. Ityknow what? It just doesn\\'t matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we\\'re okay?\\nTag: Um, I\\'m not.\\nRachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.\\nTag: No, you didn\\'t. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.\\nRachel: Really?\\nTag: Yeah, so, please don\\'t fire me for doing this.\\nRachel: Okay, well, that\\'s one less thing we have to do on Monday.\\nEnding Credits\\nRoss: Delaware!

You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.\\nMonica: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn\\'t wanna live there anymore?\\nPhoebe: Maybe on some level.\\nRachel: Joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.\\nJoey: What is Rock \\'n\\' Roll about that?\\nPhoebe:\\nJoey: Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?\\nPhoebe: It\\'s atarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel, look, I\\'m sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?\\nRachel: What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn\\'t this cool?\\nJoey: Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it\\'s on me! I got, hey!\\nRachel: Oh, isn\\'t that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.\\nPhoebe:\\nRachel: What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what\\'s the matter?\\nPhoebe: Our apartment is ready.\\nRachel: And that makes you angry because\\nPhoebe: Because you would rather live here with Joey.\\nRachel: Where did you get that?\\nPhoebe: Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.\\nRachel: Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Hm?\\nRachel: Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!\\nPhoebe:  Fish!\\nRachel: It wouldn\\'t have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we\\'re roommates; that\\'s the deal.\\nPhoebe: Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you\\'re having so much fun over here\\nRachel: Oh, it\\'s so much more fun with you.\\nPhoebe: We did have fun, didn\\'t we?\\nRachel: We did!\\nPhoebe: Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.\\nRachel: Oh, I would love to!\\nPhoebe: Yay, okay!\\nRachel: Good, good, good, good, good.\\nPhoebe: Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.\\nRachel:  Done!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nSalesman: Hello, Sir. You\\'re here to return those pants?\\nRoss: No, these are my pants.\\nSalesman: Oh. Okay! How can I help you?\\nRoss: Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?\\nSalesman: Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.\\nRoss: Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don\\'t want to disappoint him, um, come on, Iuh, you gotta have something.\\nRoss: I\\'m the holiday armadillo! I\\'m a friend of Santa\\'s and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!\\nMonica: What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?\\nRoss:  Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.\\nMonica: Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way fromTexas.\\nBen: Texas?\\nRoss: That\\'s right, Ben. I\\'m Santa\\'s representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.\\nBen: Wow! Thanks!\\nRoss: You\\'re welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!\\nBen: Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I\\'m part-Jewish.\\nRoss:  You are? Me, too!\\nMonica: Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?\\nRoss:  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?\\nBen: Cool!\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nMonica: Come on Ben.\\nRoss: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...\\nChandler:  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\\nBen: Santa!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nRoss: What are you doing here, Santa?\\nChandler: Well, I\\'m here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weirdturtle-man?\\nRoss: I\\'m the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?\\nChandler: What?\\nBen: Did you bring me any presents, Santa?\\nChandler: You bet I did, Ben, put it there!  Ho, ho, ho!\\nMonica: Okay Ben, why don\\'t you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There\\'s a sentence, I never thought I\\'d say.\\nRoss:  What are you doing?\\nChandler: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\\nRoss: Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.\\nChandler: Why?\\nRoss: Because, I\\'m finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you\\'re-youre wrecking it.\\nChandler: But I didn\\'t get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\\nRoss: I\\'m sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.\\nChandler: Fine, I\\'ll give the suit back.\\nMonica:\\nChandler: Santa? Really?\\nMonica: Yes, is that okay?\\nChandler: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\\nMonica: No.\\nChandler: Then it\\'s okay!\\nRoss: Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!\\nBen: No! Why does he have to go?\\nChandler: Because, if Santa and the HolidayArmadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!\\nBen: No! Why can\\'t the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!\\nRoss: Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.\\nChandler: Well, I\\'ll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?\\nBen: Okay, Santa!\\nRoss: All right, it\\'s time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.\\nJoey:  Merry Christmas!\\nRachel: Oh wow! Look at this place!\\nPhoebe: Oh, this is terrible. Oh, theyve made so many changes I cant even feel my grandmothers presence anymoreOoh! New sconces!\\nRachel:  Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: What?\\nRachel:  Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nRachel: And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nRachel: Do you really not know where Im going with this?  It left! Its one huge room!\\nPhoebe: Oh no!  Oh! Wow!!!\\nRachel: See?\\nPhoebe: Well, I guess well just have to put the wall back up.\\nRachel: You cant, because of the new skylight!\\nPhoebe: Theres a skylight?!  Wow!!\\nRachel: So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?\\nPhoebe:  Yknow Im-Im sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.\\nRachel: Oh yeah? Startin to feel her again there are we?\\nPhoebe: A little bit, yeah.\\nRachel: Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?\\nPhoebe: You heard her too?! You have the gift!\\nRachel: Phoebe, its okay. I like living with Joey.\\nPhoebe: Are you sure?\\nRachel: Oh please, I hate packing, its closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, Im really gonna miss living with you.\\nPhoebe: Oh me too.\\nRachel: I know.  Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?\\nPhoebe: No, I do not hear that.\\nRoss: and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for\\nBen:  Eight whole days.\\nRoss: Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.\\nBen: Awesome!\\nRoss: Yeah?\\nChandler: My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.\\nRoss: The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, its time to light the Hanukkah candles!\\nRachel:  Hey!\\nPhoebe: Oh.\\nRachel:  Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here.\\nRoss: Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!\\nRachel: Oh.\\nPhoebe: Oh.\\nPhoebe: Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunnys funeral?\\nEnding Credits\\nRachel: I got it!\\nJoey:  Is it back in the cage?\\nRachel: Its back in cage!\\nJoey: Cage closed?\\nRachel: Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!\\nEnd\\n======== 07-11\\nWritten by: Shana Goldberg-Meehan Transcribed by: Eric Aasen With Help from: Aaron Howard-Miller\\nChandler: Ohh.

Somebody sent it to us.\\nRachel: Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.\\nChandler: Ino! I didn\\'t read the box before I opened it. And you can\\'t return a box after you\\'ve opened the box.\\nRachel: Why, why not?\\nChandler: Because it\\'s too delicious.\\nRachel: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.\\nChandler: No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  I feel terrible, Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.\\nRachel:  Oh, Im sorry what?\\nOpening Credits\\nJoey: All right, I should get going, big day a work.

I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!\\nChandler: Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.\\nRoss: Well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.\\nMonica: Yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadnt have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too.\\nRoss: Yknow, she tried to undress me too.\\nChandler: I used to undress my cousin Glenn.\\nPhoebe: Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!\\nRachel: Umm, I think hes still out. Whats wrong?\\nPhoebe: Well, Ill tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.\\nRachel:  Big Daddy?\\nPhoebe: Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.\\nRoss: Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on?

That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!\\nJoey: Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!\\nRoss: Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.\\nPhoebe: I dont accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better! Yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!\\nJoey: Wow! Im so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.\\nPhoebe: Well, it does.\\nJoey: Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? Im sorry.  How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?!

Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?\\nChandler: Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!\\nRachel: It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!\\nChandler:  Yknow what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.\\nRachel: Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.\\nChandler: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?\\nRachel: Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.\\nJoey: Awww! Mel Torme died.\\nMonica: Joey, that papers like a year old!\\nJoey: Aw!

Ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.\\nMonica: Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person!\\nRoss: Well yeah, but she doesnt know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.\\nMonica:  Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! Thats not the reason shes not inviting me!\\nRoss: Oh whats the big deal?! I wasnt even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and yknow what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as a sign of protest.\\nMonica: Joan?\\nRoss: Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. Shes an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!\\nMonica: Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnt invited and you got \"and guest?!\"\\nJoey: Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Rosss behalf. I-I think the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back\\nRoss:  Not broad backed!\\nMonica: Wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!\\nRoss: What? I cant cancel on Joan!\\nMonica: Why not?!\\nRoss: BecDid you not hear me?! Shes an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? Theyre wild!

Do you see what I see?\\nRachel:\\nChandler: Mrs. Braverman must be out.\\nRachel: She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.\\nChandler: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.\\nRachel: No that could kill her.\\nChandler: Well, we dont want that.\\nRachel: No so were protecting her.\\nChandler: But we should take it.\\nRachel: But we should move quick.\\nChandler: Why?\\nRachel: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.\\nChandler: Go!

Maybe, maybe Ill take her down to the incinerator. Its gonna be so said, and kinda cool.  Shes heeled!\\nRachel: Thats weird.\\nJoey: No its not weird, its a miracle!\\nRachel: Its not a miracle Joey! Im sure theres some explanation.\\nJoey: Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!\\nRachel: Joey, I really dont\\nJoey:  Can you tell me how this happened?\\nRachel: Well no.\\nJoey: Miracle!\\nRachel: No, yknow what?

Its not like I did it on purpose.\\nRoss: Dad that wont matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff!

And if you say the words medical marvel Im going to Easy Bake your head!\\nMr. Geller: Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.\\nMonica: So wait, Rosss stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!\\nMr. Geller: There was also leaves and guk and stuff.\\nMonica: I cant believe this!\\nMr. Geller:\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: Hey Chandler!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nRachel: How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?\\nChandler: Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore.\\nRachel: Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?\\nChandler:  Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete?

The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!\\nRachel: No-no-no!

Like a gang or something?!\\nJoey: Yeah! We are!\\nRachel: Were the Cobras!\\nPhoebe:  Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl?

Its funny!\\nChandler: No, because youre not a grandmother!\\nRachel: No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things. Thats why its so funny.\\nMonica: All you had to do was buy the card!\\nRoss: Hey! Look whos back! Its the birthday girl! Hows the birthday girl feeling?\\nRachel: Well, I feel fine, but I think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Okay! Yknow what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids\\nPhoebe: Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.\\nRachel: As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!\\nPhoebe: If you could do that, Id marry the hippity-hop.\\nRachel: So, if I wanna have my kid when Im 35, I dont have to get pregnant until Im 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant\\nMonica: Really! That long?!  Look all you want, its happening!\\nRachel: No, so I dont have to get married until Im 33! Thats three years, thats three whole yearsOh, wait a minute though. Ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and Id like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the time Im thirty.\\nRoss: Which is fine! Because you just turnedtwenty-eight!\\nRachel: No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!\\nJoey: Will you quit hoggin it!\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel:  Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk.\\nRoss:  Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.\\nChandler:  There we go.\\nJoey:  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?\\nChandler:  How are you feeling?\\nMonica: You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!\\nRoss: I really wish that you wouldnt.\\nChandler:  Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.\\nPhoebe:  Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?\\nChandler: Pheebs!!\\nPhoebe: Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!\\nMrs. Geller: Speech! Come on Monica!\\nRoss: Come on!\\nAll: Come on!

My family and my friends\\nPhoebe:  Wooo!! Hoo!!\\nMonica: I really like to say that Im-um\\nPhoebe:\\nJoey: Yeah!!\\nPhoebe: I lost a whole year! I cant believe it! This is so unfair!\\nJoey: Oh, I dont know Pheebs. Itll be okay.\\nPhoebe: Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?\\nJoey: Thats not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!\\nPhoebe: Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! II havent done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!\\nJoey: Like what?\\nPhoebe: Like okay I-I-I, I havent met any Portuguese people! I, I havent had the perfect kiss! And I havent been to snipers school!\\nMonica: Phoebe, yknow why dont we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?\\nPhoebe: No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? Ill see you guys later. Thanks.\\nRachel: Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.\\nJoey: Hey, yknow what you guys? I think Im gonna go walk her home.\\nMonica: Oh man!\\nChandler: What?\\nMonica: Hes gonna eat the cake!\\nJoey: Pheebs! Wait up!

Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna lift the carand slide it out. Lift and slide!\\nRachel: Ross, I really dont think\\nRoss:  Lift!!

My character is coming out of his coma!!\\nAll: Oh!!\\nChandler: Thats great!\\nJoey: And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!!\\nChandler: So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!\\nRachel: Wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain?\\nJoey: Oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.\\nRoss: What? A brain transplant?!\\nJoey:  Yes, its a highly controversial procedure.\\nRoss: Its ridiculous!\\nJoey: Well, I think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months.\\nRoss:\\nMonica: Who are they killing off?\\nJoey: Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.\\nRachel and Monica: Noo!!\\nMonica: Shes my favorite character on DOOL.\\nJoey: Nice.\\nRachel: She is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, I mean I dont think Ive ever seen her finish a beverage.\\nMonica: And the way she slaps all the time!\\nRachel: Oh!\\nMonica: Wouldnt you love to do it just once?!\\nChandler: Dont do it.\\nRachel: Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.\\nJoey: Oh, tell me about it.

Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!\\nOpening Credits\\nPhoebe:  Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?\\nRachel:  Well, I\\'d have to say gay.\\nPhoebe: Yeah? Why?\\nRachel: Well mainly because he\\'s kissing that other guy.\\nPhoebe: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.\\nRachel: Oh yeah he\\'s too cute to be straight.\\nPhoebe:\\nRachel: All right, straight, and not subtle.\\nPhoebe: Ohh, he left his cell phone.\\nRachel: Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he\\'ll put it in lost and found.\\nPhoebe: Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.\\nRachel: What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn\\'t that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.\\nPhoebe: Yeah That does sound great. I\\'m going to get the phone.\\nRachel: What? Wait! Whywhy do you get the story?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t been out on a date in so long.\\nRachel: Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.\\nPhoebe: That wasnt a date! That was, that was just friends getting together having sex.\\nRachel: Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.\\nPhoebe: No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.\\nRachel: Yeah!  And until now, I didnt think Id love again.\\nPhoebe: Nice try.\\nRachel: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?\\nPhoebe: I dont know.\\nRachel: Well umm, maybe we could uhh  Ah-ha! Too slow!!\\nPhoebe: Ah-ha! Too cocky!\\nDina: Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!\\nJessica Lockhart: Oh yes there is!\\nDina: What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!\\nJessica Lockhart:  That was an accident! And so were you.\\nDina: Well, at least Im not a murderer!\\nJessica Lockhart:\\nThe Director: Cut!\\nJoey: That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?\\nCecilia: Oh, just years of experience.\\nDina:  Can I get some ice here?!\\nJoey: Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.\\nCecilia: Youre not the fan whos dying are you?\\nJoey: Say what?\\nCecilia: Im supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!\\nJoey: No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!\\nCecilia: Oh that was a real person?!\\nJoey: An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me\\nCecilia: I-I-Im leaving the show?\\nJoey:  I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?\\nCecilia: Who told you that?\\nJoey: Oh uh, one of the writers.\\nCecilia: Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?\\nJoey: Umm\\nCecilia: Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!\\nJoey: Okay.\\nCecilia: And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that Ive been playing for 20 yearsIll give you a tip!\\nJoey: Ms. Monroe\\nRachel: No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.\\nPhoebe: Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.\\nRachel: I dont think so.\\nPhoebe:  Fine all right, but Id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.\\nRachel:  All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.\\nPhoebe: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.\\nRachel: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.\\nPhoebe: Did I use that already today? Im sorry.\\nRachel: Yes okay.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hats a steak house!\\nPhoebe: Okay, a meat eater. Fine, thats one for you.\\nRachel:  Oh, I win! Hes got Barneys on his speed dial.\\nPhoebe: So you dont know thats Barneys the store! That can be yknow his friends house, or a bar. Who has Barneys the store on their speed dial?\\nRachel:  His new girlfriend!\\nMonica: What is that?\\nChandler: I think its the dying cat parade.\\nMonica: It sounds like its coming from across the street.\\nChandler:  Oh my God!\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, \"Youre half Scottish right?\"\\nMonica: Nooo!!\\nChandler: Yes!!\\nCommercial Break\\nMonica: No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!\\nChandler: Why is your family Ross?!\\nMonica: He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! Its not even a song!\\nChandler: If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.\\nRachel: Hi Pheebs!\\nPhoebe: Hi!\\nRachel: How are ya?\\nPhoebe: Good.\\nRachel: Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nRachel: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?\\nPhoebe: Yeah!\\nRachel: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!\\nPhoebe: Ooh, now you lost me.\\nRachel: You stole the phone!\\nPhoebe: No I didnt!\\nRachel: No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?\\nPhoebe: No.\\nRachel: Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.\\nRachel: Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: That is a different phone.\\nRachel: Oh is it?!  Its for me!\\nPhoebe: That is damning evidence.\\nRachel: Oh my God! I bet thats him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh  Would you stop doing that?!\\nPhoebe:  Yes, Im the one who found your phone.\\nRachel: Phoebe! You cant do th\\nPhoebe:\\nRachel: You do know that I will be here when he comes over.\\nPhoebe: Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?\\nRachel: You just said it!\\nPhoebe: Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would justbe alone yknow to think about my mom and her suicide.\\nRachel: Oh Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: What?! Thats the first time today!\\nRachel: Ohh!\\nJoey: So you like the nachos uh? Myself Im partial to\\nDina:  Im 16.\\nJoey: See you in 2003.\\nCecilia:  Youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They dont know exactly when its going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and thats it.\\nJoey: Im so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.\\nCecilia: Yeah, thanks.\\nJoey: No I mean it! I cant believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!\\nCecilia: Oh youre right. Thank you! Whats your name again?\\nJoey: Joey.\\nCecilia: Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.\\nThe Writer: It wasnt my decision!\\nCecilia:  You were saying?\\nJoey: Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, Im really nervous about-about being you. Yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Yknow? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?\\nCecilia: All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.\\nJoey: Oh thats great! Oh thank you so much!\\nCecilia: Youre so welcome.\\nJoey: Hey! Now, Ive been watching some tapes, hows this?  \"Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!\"\\nCecilia: Is that supposed to be me?\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nCecilia: Yeah but Jessica doesnt have an English accent.\\nJoey:  I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my resume!\\nChandler: Well, I feel like a snack!\\nMonica: Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.\\nChandler: Oh no thanks. I dont like any thing from my Scottish heritage.\\nRoss: What?!\\nChandler: Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.\\nRoss: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.\\nMonica: No! No-no theyre not. Theyre still very angry! But yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.\\nRoss: Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more\\nMonica:  You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!\\nRoss: How did you know about that?!\\nChandler: We heard you play all the way from your apartment!\\nRoss: Were you the ones called the cops?!\\nChandler: Thats not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.\\nRoss: Why not?\\nChandler: Because we hate them.\\nRoss: Come on thats not fair! I mean you havent even heard me play!\\nChandler: We have heard you play.\\nRoss: No, youve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And Im not going to tell you what song Im gonna play either. But uh, lets just say when its over Ill bet there will be a we bit o celebration.\\nCecilia: So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  You try.\\nJoey: Okay!  All right!\\nCecilia: No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! Hes not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.\\nJoey: Okay. Okay.\\nCecilia: Right. Hes not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!  Oh well, Im gonna miss this woman so much. I dont know what Im going to do! I mean, its been 20 years of my life.\\nJoey: Oh wellHey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Yknow? Itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. Youre so talented.\\nCecilia: I am. I am, but I dont know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.\\nJoey: Hey thats not true! Look at uh, look at Angela LansbAngelina Jolie!\\nCecilia: I probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but yknow I just got so comfy here! And Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!\\nJoey: Like-like what?\\nCecilia: Well, lets just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!\\nJoey:  Wow!\\nCecilia: But Well now, nows a different time for me.\\nJoey: Oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, Im thinking, \"Boy, she-she is a great actress!\"  Uh but-but, I am also thinking, \"She is hot!\"\\nCecilia:  You think Im hot?\\nJoey: You own the room.  We should probably get-get uh\\nCecilia: Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the\\nJoey: Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that cause shes so passionate?\\nCecilia: No! Its because that way the camera only sees her!  Do you wanna try it?\\nJoey: Yeah! Okay.\\nCecilia: That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: Hey! Hey!\\nPhoebe and Rachel:  Who is it?\\nGuy: Hi! Its Tom, Im here to pick up the phone.\\nPhoebe: Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?\\nRachel: Well why shouldnt I?!\\nPhoebe: Because its my apartment!\\nRachel: Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.\\nPhoebe: Okay. All right.  Good luck explaining all the calls to China.\\nTom: Hi!\\nPhoebe:  Wow!

Its not like its porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Yknow? And the nudity is really important to the story.\\nMonica: Thats what you say about porn.\\nJoey: Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.\\nMonica: No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!\\nJoey: Well thats true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. Its really sweet and-and tender.\\nMonica: Plus, everyones gonna see your thing.\\nPhoebe: Well when can we have this shower?\\nRachel: She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday\\nPhoebe: Well thats only two days away. What is the other option?\\nRachel: Yesterday!\\nPhoebe: Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo!

Its impossible! We cant do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!\\nPhoebe: Rachel, calm down!\\nRachel:  Okay. Im sorry. Youre right, youre right.\\nPhoebe:  Just calm down woman!\\nRachel: Phoebe, I already, I already did.\\nPhoebe: Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.\\nRachel: Okay. Okay.  I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?\\nPhoebe: Uh, here. What time?\\nRachel: 4 oclock. Food?\\nPhoebe: Finger sandwiches and tea.\\nRachel: Ooh great! Very Monica.\\nPhoebe: And chili!\\nRachel: Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?\\nPhoebe: Both!\\nRachel: Were paying for this yknow.\\nPhoebe: Neither.\\nRachel: Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?\\nPhoebe: Lusts of the flesh.\\nRachel:  What?\\nPhoebe: I dont know.  A cowboy theme?\\nChandler: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nChandler: Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.\\nMonica: Oh boy me too!\\nChandler: Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours\\nMonica: Yeah?\\nChandler: Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!\\nMonica: The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!\\nChandler: Thats me! Come on!\\nMonica: Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.\\nChandler: Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.\\nMonica: Shrill?! The wedding is back on!\\nCassie: I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.\\nChandler:  Hi! Nice to meet you!\\nCassie: Nice to meet you too.\\nMonica: So, are you ready to go?\\nCassie: Yeah.\\nMonica:  Chandler!\\nChandler: Ill be right with you.\\nMonica:  Cassie needs to stay at your place.\\nRoss: Whatwhy?\\nMonica: Because Purvry Perverson over here cant stop staring at her.\\nRoss: What?! Chandler shes our cousin!\\nChandler: I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.\\nMonica: You were staring about eight inches south of there.\\nRoss: Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.\\nMonica: She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.\\nChandler: Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?\\nMonica: Wafer thin ice!\\nJoey: Hey, Im back!\\nThe Casting Director: Hi-hi Joey.\\nJoey: Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?\\nThe Casting Director: Actually, I tried to call to you. You didnt need to come down here today.\\nJoey: Oh great! Yknow I wouldve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!\\nThe Casting Director: Wait Joey! You didnt need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.\\nJoey: And scene! Huh? Wasnt that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?\\nThe Casting Director: Well, the director thinks youre really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.\\nJoey: Wow! Sure! Thats great!\\nThe Casting Director: Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.\\nJoey: Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.\\nThe Casting Director: Terrific! Well uh, theres one more thing. Uhh, uh its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt Jewish. So\\nJoey: SoWhat?\\nThe Casting Director: So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what Im saying?\\nJoey: Yes!\\nThe Casting Director: Okay.\\nJoey: No. What?\\nThe Casting Director: An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be\\nJoey: Barmifsaed?\\nMonica: So to get this part you cant be?\\nJoey: Nope.\\nMonica: But you are?\\nJoey: Yep.\\nMonica: But you told them you werent?\\nJoey: Thats right.\\nMonica: Wow! Wow! And its definitely all gone? Theres nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?\\nJoey: I dont know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.\\nMonica: Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning togrow a turtleneck!\\nJoey: I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.\\nMonica: Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!\\nJoey: I just have to call my agent and tell her I cant do the part.\\nMonica: Unless!\\nJoey: Unless what?\\nMonica: Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.\\nJoey: Like what?\\nMonica: Well Im not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head Im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.\\nPhoebe: Hey! Ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone.\\nRachel: Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list.\\nPhoebe: Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know thats coming? Me. Are you?\\nMonica:  Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nRachel: Hey! Whats up Mon?\\nMonica: Well uh, Im trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?\\nRachel: Have at it.\\nMonica: Okay.  I hope that wont work.\\nRachel: Are you makin him a sandwich?\\nMonica: No its umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, Im gonna go guys.\\nPhoebe and Rachel: Okay.\\nMonica: I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!\\nRachel:  We have to get her a present?!\\nPhoebe: Okay but look! Look at what I got! Its her address book!  We have a guest list!\\nRachel: Oh my God youre amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.\\nRoss:  Cassie?!\\nCassie: Hey Ross!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nCassie:  Its been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.\\nRoss: Oh. Oh, thats right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didnt.\\nCassie: Ah yeah, sorry about that.\\nRoss: Its okay. Come, come on in.\\nCassie: Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.\\nRoss: Oh.\\nCassie: Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!\\nRoss: Uh-huh.

Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.\\nMonica: Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I wont let you drive the Porsche is because youre a terrible driver. There!

So why dont you just hand over the keys?\\nRachel: Oh.\\n{Transcribers Note: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? Its a tradition left over from Porsches racing history. The worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The drivers left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. Thats why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}\\nRoss: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!\\nRachel: Look Ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car!\\nRoss: With you?! Yeah right!\\nRachel: All right.\\nRoss:\\nRachel: What are you doing?!

Chandler you have to tell him!\\nChandler: No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in different departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while.

It is a family name!\\nRoss: Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?\\nJoey\\'s Co-Star: Drake, Ive discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.\\nDr. Drake Ramoray: What is it?\\nJoey\\'s Co-Star: Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessicas brain.\\nDr. Drake Ramoray: Is it serious?\\nJoey\\'s Co-Star: Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.\\nDr. Drake Ramoray: Well that sounds simple enough, lets just do that.\\nJoey\\'s Co-Star: We would, but when we went to exhume Jessicas body, it was gone.\\nDirector: Cut! Very nice people!\\nJoey:  Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.\\nRachel: Well dontWhat happened to Jessicas body?!\\nJoey: Im not telling, youll have to see it on TV!\\nRachel: You dont know do you?\\nJoey: No, couldnt care less.\\nJoey\\'s Co-Star: Hey good scene man.\\nJoey: Hey you too!\\nJoey\\'s Co-Star: Alright.\\nJoey: What?

Well look at that, Im just stroking your arm.\\nJoey:\\nRachel: Oh, were leaving. Bye Kash.\\nKash: Bye.\\nRachel: Say hi to Wally.\\nPhoebe: Ooh Monica!\\nMonica: Hi!\\nPhoebe: Oh my God!

Okay, hes slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!\\nPhoebe: Well maybe he was just nervous, yknow you can be very intimidating. And besides Ive met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.\\nMonica: Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.\\nPhoebe: But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?\\nMonica:  All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!\\nPhoebe: Thats fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.\\nMonica: I paid to have this done.\\nPhoebe: Love it!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nJoey: Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.\\nRachel: I thought I was a complete idiot.\\nJoey: Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out with him.\\nRachel: Oh!

So now Im not allowed to fire him?\\nPhoebe: You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.\\nMonica: Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.\\nPhoebe: Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill myself!\\nMonica: Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!\\nPhoebe: Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.\\nMonica: What do you mean?\\nPhoebe: Come on! The boss that fires a guy thats just been dumped, bitch!

Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?\\nRoss: I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble.

She put you on the map!\\nRoss: As a romancer of the elderly.\\nMonica: Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.\\nRoss: The eyesdid still sparkle.\\nMonica: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve been through so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?\\nRachel: Shes right.\\nRoss: Yeah.

Could you draw me a picture of us having  sex on the balcony?\\nMonica: Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff!  I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got  you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath!\\nChandler: Well, this does butch it up a bit.\\nMonica: I swear, if you try it, you will love it!\\nChandler: All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?\\nMonica: Absolutely.\\nMonica: Bet I know how that discussions going to go.\\nChandler:  All right, this isnt so bad. I like the flower  smell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat.\\nMonica:  So?\\nChandler: Oh my God.\\nMonica: I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you  a facial!\\nChandler: Im going to need a bigger boat.\\nRoss: I dont think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on,  little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?\\nRachel: Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!\\nDr. Long: Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing  the sex of the baby?\\nRoss: Uh, no. No, were not.\\nRachel: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether  its a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?\\nDr. Long: Thats right. But if you dont want to know\\nRoss: No, no, we want to wait, right?\\nRachel: Right. Right.\\nDr. Long:  Oh, Ill be right back. And, uh, I know  its really not my place, but please dont name your child Phoebo.\\nRachel:  So, which of these  babies do you think is the ugliest?\\nRoss: What? Rach! Come on, thats terrible!  Theyreuhtheyre babies. Theyre-theyre all beautiful.\\nRachel: Third one from the left?\\nRoss: Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows Im talking about it.

I  swear; I didnt see anything, and I dont want to know! It was just a momentary  lapse.\\nRoss: Momentary lapse. Dont-dont you have any self-control?\\nRachel:  Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.\\nMonica: Hello?\\nChandler: Im in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think theres  something wrong.\\nMonica: You know what? I-I think Ill wait out here.\\nChandler: Im in the bathtub.\\nMonica: Oh.  Whats wrong?\\nChandler: I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The salt  didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont  compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: The bath salts! Theyre starting to effervesce! Its different.   Its interesting.\\nMonica: Okay, lets talk about something else.\\nChandler: Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!\\nMonica: Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking  about rules and right and wrong and\\nChandler: I had the exact same conversation.\\nMonica: You did? What was he talking about?\\nChandler: I dont know! Joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out  words since we saw him in Macbeth!\\nMonica:  That was a long night.\\nChandler: All right, lets break this down. What exactly did he say to you?\\nMonica: Okay, he was talking about rules.\\nChandler: Uh-huh.\\nMonica: Umm, and looking at people differently.\\nChandler: He didnt say anything about that to me.\\nMonica: What did he tell you?\\nChandler: He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of  course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.\\nMonica: Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants  to do what you and I did in London with someone.\\nChandler: But what did he mean by rules?\\nMonica: Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!\\nChandler: Because he was looking at her differently.\\nMonica: And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!\\nChandler: My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!\\nPhoebe:  You guys?\\nMonica: Just a minute!  Thats Mrs. Tribbiani!\\nChandler: You dont say anything.\\nMonica: Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the  greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all  start having babies?\\nChandler: Im not going to let you say anything.\\nMonica: You just stay here!\\nChandler: Oh, God!\\nPhoebe: Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.\\nMonica: Oh, you had that?\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh.\\nMonica: I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.\\nPhoebe: Oh, just as well, I broke this one.\\nPhoebe: What?\\nMonica: Nothing.\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nMonica: I mean, I-I, I really shouldnt say. I mean, Im really not  supposed to.\\nPhoebe: Fine.\\nMonica: Its a humdinger!\\nPhoebe: Then its really too bad that you cant tell me.\\nMonica: Somebody likes you!\\nPhoebe:  Is it Chandler?\\nMonica: No!\\nPhoebe: Well, then tell him to stop staring!\\nMonica: Its Joey!\\nPhoebe: Really?! Joey?! You dont say.\\nMonica: Is it something youd be interested in?\\nPhoebe: I dont know, I dont know, I dont know. You know, I mean,  on the one hand, Mother may I? But yknow on the other hand No. No, I  cant. Were friends. No, oh, no. I dont want to risk what we have.\\nMonica: I guess that makes sense. So, you think youre going to talk to him?\\nPhoebe: Sure, yeah. I mean, its Joey. I dont want him to get hurt.  Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!\\nMonica: Not Chandler, just Joey.\\nPhoebe: Sure.\\nCommercial Break\\nRachel: Hey.\\nRoss: Hey.\\nRachel: You know what? Ive been thinking about it. Im really coming  around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.\\nRoss: Rach, I-I cant tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh Wait a  minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind?  Unless, you know were never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You  know its a boy!\\nRachel: I didnt see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.\\nRoss: I dont think so! Youre just giving me Ruth so youll get to  name it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him Heath  or Blaine or Sequoia.\\nRachel: I wouldSequoia?\\nRoss: Veto.\\nRachel: Fine.\\nRoss: Unless  You anticipated that I would figure all  this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named  Ruth! Well, Im not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!\\nRachel: But Ross, you want the name Ruth!\\nRoss: Not like this!\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nJoey: Hey.

You want to hear it?\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nJoey: She made me switch to light Mayo. Thats it! Thats all I got! And,  you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!\\nPhoebe: Joey, I just think youre getting worked up over nothing. This is  probably just a crush.\\nJoey: You think?\\nPhoebe: Absolutely! Yknow, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes  away.\\nJoey: Yeah, just a crush! Thats all this is! Its a crush! Im  Joey; I dont get deep feelings.\\nPhoebe: Thats right, there you go!

You guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.\\nChandler:  I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, \"I love you,\" was, \"Oh crap!\"\\nMonica: Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when theyre hungry.\\nJoey: All right so, so what do I do?\\nMonica: This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know its weird, its awkward, but you gotta at least try.\\nJoey: Yeah. Okay.

I love that shirt!\\nRachel: Well just ask Mona to give it back!\\nRoss: I dont know. I mean I-I guess I could. Its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.\\nPhoebe:\\nChandler: Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?\\nRachel: Hi!\\nJoey: Hey.\\nRachel: Hi.\\nJoey: Hi.\\nMonica: Tea gives Phoebe the trots.\\nRachel: So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.\\nChandler: I know its tough now, but things will get better.\\nRachel: How do you know that?

I feel so terrible for you!\\nMonica: Okay, I-Im sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject.

Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower\\nAunt Lisa: Oh that is so sweet!\\nRachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!\\nRoss: Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down.

Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks.

Hes just too excited abouteverything. I mean Im all for living life, but this is the Gellers 35th anniversary. Okay? Lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.\\nJoey: I know Im having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!\\nPhoebe: Are you sure it wasnt an oyster?\\nJoey: I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it. Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.\\nPhoebe: Hes just such a great guy Im so excited about him.\\nJoey: Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy.\\nPhoebe: You think?\\nJoey: Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.\\nPhoebe: Youre right. Youre right, hes just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! Im a sunny, positive person.\\nJoey: Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.\\nPhoebe: Whats that now?\\nJoey: Nothing\\nPhoebe: Oh look its Parker!\\nParker: Look! Its the bunny hop!\\nPhoebe: Oooh I love it!\\nParker: You do?!\\nPhoebe: Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!\\nMonica: Okay its time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.\\nMonica: No, no its going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably dont say it enough, but I love you.  You people are made of stone! Heres to mom and dad! Whatever!\\nMrs. Geller: Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting.

On our 35th wedding anniversary\\nRoss: No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that ifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.\\nMrs. Geller:  Oh Ross\\nMr. Geller: I just wish Nana were alive to hear Rosss toast.\\nParker: My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!\\nPhoebe: Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?\\nParker: I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words\\nPhoebe: Oh thank God.\\nParker: Its a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst\\nPhoebe: Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why dont we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!\\nParker: That sounds great.\\nPhoebe: Lets try something else, lets play a game.\\nParker: I love games!\\nPhoebe: Shocking! Lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.\\nParker: OrJenga.\\nPhoebe: But, lets play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!\\nParker: I lose, now Jenga.\\nPhoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God!\\nParker: Is something wrong?\\nPhoebe: Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isnt perfect? Everything isnt magical? Everything isnt a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!\\nParker: Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!\\nPhoebe: You dont have to put a good spin on everything.\\nParker: Im sorry thats who I am. Im a positive person.\\nPhoebe: No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!\\nParker: So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?\\nPhoebe: Much less happy!\\nParker: Fine! Well then to quote Ross, \"Id better be going.\"\\nPhoebe: So long! Dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!\\nParker: Isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your entire life?\\nPhoebe: Uh huh.\\nRoss: and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!\\nRachel: Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.\\nRoss: But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?\\nRachel: It was really fun being married to you tonight.\\nRoss: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.\\nRachel: Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nRachel: That proposal, at the planetarium\\nRoss: I know, I know it was stupid.\\nRachel: Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It wasreally wonderful! Did you just make that up?\\nRoss: No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.

But what youre during to me now is just plain spiteful!\\nMrs. Green: Spiteful?!\\nMonica: Thats right! Maybe its time you took a good hard look at a mirror young ladyold ladylady!\\nPhoebe:  Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up\\nMonica: So whenever youre ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.

It still could last a little while longer. If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.\\nRoss: Do them!!\\nDr. Long: Actually, theyre things you can do.

Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again.\\nPhoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.\\nRoss: Look, I didnt want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnt want to either. But I dont, I dont understand how any of this happened! What?

I didnt propose!  Did I? I havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something I would do.\\nCommercial Break\\nChandler: Look, we cant stay in here forever.\\nMonica: Oh, I still cant believe my dad saw us having sex!

I dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.\\nMr. Geller: Youre right, youre right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.\\nMonica: I dont feel good right now.\\nMr. Geller: But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

Ah!! Ahh!!!\\nJoey: Here you are\\nRachel: Thank you Joey. You know what? I\\'m not even sure   I can have caffeine.\\nRoss: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee   won\\'t affect your milk.\\nRachel: Yeah. Just to be sure I\\'m gonna call Dr. Wiener.\\nJoey:\\nRachel: Every time?\\nJoey: Uhuh.\\nRoss: Rach, you don\\'t have to call whenever you have a little   question, okay? Trust me, I know this.\\nRachel: All right, I trust you.\\nRoss: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don\\'t understand why...\\nRachel: I\\'m on the phone!\\nJoey:\\nPhoebe: It\\'s so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.   It\\'s just so grown up.\\nJoey: I know, yeah. I feel like we\\'re all growing up. Person   named Wiener, God that kills me.\\nPhoebe: Look at you all grown up.\\nJoey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with   Rachel made me realize that maybe I\\'m ready for a more serious relationship.   You know? Like I\\'d like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks   aren\\'t as important as...Nah, she\\'s gotta be hot.\\nPhoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date!\\nJoey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?\\nPhoebe: Done. Oh good, really?\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nPhoebe: Let\\'s see!  Oh, you know   who\\'s great? Sandy Poophack.\\nJoey:\\nPhoebe: Yeah...

You don\\'t have to move to Tulsa.   You can stay here and keep your job.\\nMonica: It\\'s great! How?\\nChandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only   have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with   you.\\nMonica: So you\\'re gonna be gone four days a week?  No.\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry, are you just used to saying that?\\nMonica: No. I can\\'t be away from you for that long.\\nChandler: Really?\\nMonica: Yeah, you\\'re my husband. I\\'m not gonna live in a   different state than you for 208 days out of the year.\\nChandler: That\\'s fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.\\nMonica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but   if you\\'re going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.\\nChandler: Hey, you said that without gagging!\\nMonica: I know!\\nRachel:\\nRoss: Who the hell was that?!\\nRachel: Dr. Wiener.\\nRoss: Rach, you can\\'t call people at three in the morning.\\nRachel: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!\\nRoss: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?\\nRachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I\\'m not insane!\\nRoss: Well, what was it?\\nRachel: Hiccups.\\nRoss: Rach, I told you, you can\\'t call him every time any   little thing comes up.\\nRachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can\\'t. He fired us! What   are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that   when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?\\nRoss: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don\\'t think that\\'s a   good idea. In fact, I think he\\'s dead.\\nRachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!\\nRoss: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we\\'ll find another   doctor, but I gotta get up early and I\\'m not feeling all that well.\\nRachel: What? What, do you mean you\\'re not feeling well?   What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don\\'t go near Emma, she has not had   that shot.\\nRoss: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!\\nRachel:  Wiener, Wiener!!!\\nRoss:  Rachel!!!\\nRachel: Great! Now he\\'s gonna know it was me!\\nPhoebe:  Hey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nPhoebe: So how is this for our big double date tonight?\\nJoey:  Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.\\nJoey: Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn\\'t forget?\\nPhoebe: Of course not! And you\\'re gonna love Mary Ellen.   She\\'s really smart and cute and funny, and I can\\'t tell you how I know this,   but she\\' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.\\nJoey: No.\\nPhoebe: Come on, give me something. What\\'s his name?\\nJoey: Mike.\\nPhoebe: Mike? Okay! What\\'s his last name?\\nJoey: Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?\\nPhoebe: All right, we\\'ll se you and Mike at the restaurant   in a couple hours.\\nJoey and Phoebe:\\nJoey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don\\'t know a Mike! Why   couldn\\'t I have said...  There\\'s no guy in   there!\\nRachel: It\\'s impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how   do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against   your knee?\\nMonica: Excuse me?\\nChandler: I know what she\\'s talking about.\\nRachel: We\\'ve got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting   sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.\\nMonica: Why don\\'t you go see Dr. Gettleman?\\nRachel: Ross said he died.\\nMonica: He didn\\'t die. I saw his daughter last week. Said   he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.\\nRachel: Oh, great! Well, then I\\'m gonna take Emma to see   him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.\\nMonica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist.\\nChandler: He saw a therapist?\\nMonica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just   really freaked him out.\\nRachel: Why? What was it?\\nMonica: That I was going to eat him.\\nJoey: MIKE!!!\\nMike: Yeah?\\nJoey:\\nMike: I gotta tell you, I can\\'t believe I\\'m doing this with   you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I   should be open and taking some risks.\\nJoey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?   All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.\\nMike: I am Mike.\\nJoey: Atta boy!\\nJoey: Okay, look...\\nEveryone:\\nPhoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do   you and Joey know each other anyway?\\nMike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a   nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.\\nJoey:  From school.\\nMike: Yeah, we met in college.  I mean,   high school.\\nPhoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up   to these days?\\nMike: Well, I\\'m a lawyer.\\nJoey: Mike, \\'attorney at law\\'!\\nMike: Actually, I just gave up my practice.\\nJoey: What? That\\'s the kinda thing you usually run by me.\\nMike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I   figured if I don\\'t do this now, I never will.\\nPhoebe: Wow, that\\'s great! I liked that better than the law   thing, so...\\nJoey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to   Mike.\\nMary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.\\nJoey: No, no, that\\'s not what I meant. Let\\'s get you a cocktail.\\nMonica: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nMonica: What are you doing?\\nChandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.\\nMonica: That\\'s so sweet. Find anything?\\nChandler: Slim Pickings.\\nMonica: Nothing, huh?\\nChandler: No, \\'Slim Pickings\\', it\\'s a barbecue restaurant.   They\\'re looking for a cook. Actually \\'cook\\' may be a bit of a stretch. They\\'re   looking for someone to shovel mesquite.\\nMonica: \\'Slim Pickings\\'...That is so cheesy.\\nChandler: \\'So Cheesy\\' also has an opening.\\nMonica: Honey, that\\'s okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,   who\\'s a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she\\'ll know of something.\\nChandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming   with me. When we get to Tulsa I\\'m taking you for a great dinner at \\'Slim Pickings\\'.   \\'So Cheesy\\'? \\'Whole Hog\\'? It\\'s going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.\\nMonica:  \\'I\\'ll take it!\\'\\nRachel: Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment   for Emma.\\nReceptionist: Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient,   he should be out shortly.\\nDr. Gettleman:  I think you just have a cold,   it\\'s definitely not Strep.\\nRoss: Thanks doctor.\\nDr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop?\\nRoss: You even have to ask?!  He is alive!\\nPhoebe: You know, it\\'s so surprising that you and Joey have   known each other for so long and I\\'ve never heard about you.\\nJoey: Yeah, that\\'s because we had a bit of a falling out.   Mike hit my mom with a car.\\nMike: No, I didn\\'t.\\nJoey: That\\'s okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we\\'re   friends again everything\\'s great!\\nMary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?\\nJoey: Please, we\\'re trying to have a conversation.\\nMary Ellen: Wow, you\\'re a lot nicer on \\'Days of Our Lives\\'.\\nMike: \\'Days of Our Lives\\'! That\\'s why you look so familiar!\\nPhoebe: What?!\\nMike: What?!\\nJoey: What?!\\nPhoebe: Do you not know each other?\\nJoey:  Hey, remember the one where I punch   you in the face for not being cool?!\\nPhoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters   does Joey have?\\nMike:  Six!\\nJoey: What are you doing? I said seven!  Argh!!!\\nPhoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?\\nJoey: Because I forgot about our date, I\\'m so sorry.\\nMike: I\\'m sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn\\'t hit his   mother with a car.\\nPhoebe:  You are unbelievable! I spent so much time   finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and   cute and loose.\\nMary Ellen: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Who are you kidding?  You just find some   guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!\\nJoey: Look Phoebe I\\'m so sorry! Hey, look, if you don\\'t like   this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!\\nPhoebe: I\\'m out of here\\nMike: It was nice meeting you!\\nJoey:  You\\'re leaving too?\\nMary Ellen: I\\'ll stay if you can tell me my name.\\nJoey: Good night!\\nChandler: Honey, we\\'re leaving tomorrow you\\'ve still got   a lot of packing to do.\\nMonica: You\\'re right.  Maybe I shouldn\\'t go.\\nChandler: What?\\nMonica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,   Javo . It\\'s just a little outside of Tulsa.\\nChandler: How far outside?\\nMonica: Manhattan.\\nChandler: And you\\'re thinking of taking it?  new job.\\nMonica: I\\'m gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it\\'s a lot   to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\\nChandler: What happened to \\'you can\\'t live without me four   days a week\\'?\\nMonica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days   is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see   you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really   if you think about it, it\\'s really just one day. And well, if we can\\'t make   it one day, we\\'ve got real problems my friend.\\nChandler: I think you should take the job.\\nMonica: Really?\\nChandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you   start chattering like a monkey.\\nMonica: That\\'s the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nMonica: How was the pediatrician?\\nRachel: Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it   was really, really, really good.\\nRoss: You promised you wouldn\\'t say anything.\\nRachel: I know.  I don\\'t care!\\nMonica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\\nRoss: He\\'s a brilliant diagnostician!\\nChandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\\nRachel: Ross, seriously! You\\'ve gotta go to an appropriate   doctor.\\nRoss: Why? Why? I know it\\'s a little weird, but hey, he\\'s   a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,   he makes a big deal. \\'Ah look, it\\'s my favorite patient!\\'\\nChandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy?\\nRoss: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!\\nChandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\\nRoss: It didn\\'t spend much time on the wall!!!\\nMike: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can   we talk?\\nPhoebe: Sure.\\nMike: I\\'m sorry, really, I\\'m so embarrassed. Really, I\\'m   a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I\\'m not a funny   guy.\\nPhoebe: Why did you go along with that?\\nMike: Because I was told I\\'d get a free dinner, which I didn\\'t.   And that I\\'d meet a pretty girl. Which I did.\\nPhoebe: That\\'s true.  Well, is anything you told me   about yourself true?\\nMike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.\\nPhoebe: Prove it.\\nMike: There isn\\'t a piano here.\\nPhoebe: That wouldn\\'t stand in the way of a true pianist.\\nMike:\\nPhoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.\\nMike: Really?\\nPhoebe: Uhuh.\\nMike: That\\'s great. What kind of music do you play?\\nPhoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right   now I\\'m working on a couple \\'Iron Maiden\\' covers.\\nMike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...\\nPhoebe: It\\'s okay. Go ahead, ask me out.\\nMike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you   out?\\nJoey:\\nPhoebe:  Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,   that would be nice.\\nJoey: Look at this. My two best friends!\\nRoss: Excuse me, I don\\'t mean to be a jerk, but the baby   with the rash came in after me.\\nReceptionist: The doctor will be right with you sir.\\nGirl:  Mommy, I can\\'t find Waldo.\\nRoss: With the circus?

I just had the best first day    ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro\\'s.\\nChandler:  Oh, that\\'s great.\\nMonica: Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean...    Monica clean.\\nChandler:  Awesome.\\nMonica: Oh, and the people are so nice. There\\'s this one guy,    Geoffrey, he\\'s the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt,    the funniest guy I have ever met.\\nOPENING CREDITS\\nMike: This is nice.\\nPhoebe: I know!\\nMike: You need both hands for that?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I kinda do.\\nJoey:\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry... I\\'m sorry. It\\'s obviously way too early    for us to be... having that conversation.\\nMike: Is it?\\nPhoebe:  Maybe not, is it?\\nMike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn\\'t think I\\'d feel this    way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn\\'t think I\\'d meet    someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have    this...  Ooh, five bucks...    I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note\\'s there...\\nPhoebe:  I know Mike, why don\\'t you keep digging?\\nMike: Oh, sorry.\\nPhoebe: Oh, it\\'s a key. To be honest, I think I\\'d prefer the    five dollars.\\nMike: It\\'s to my apartment.\\nPhoebe:  Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for    Phoebe and Mike.\\nMike: Yeah, look, and I don\\'t want you to feel like you have    to give me your key just because...\\nPhoebe: Oh no, I want to.\\nMike: Oh, thank God.\\nPhoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I\\'d never    meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.\\nMike: Is this cool, huh?\\nPhoebe: It really is.\\nJoey:\\nRachel: So I don\\'t go back to work for another four weeks,    but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance    to know her.\\nProspective nanny:\\nRachel: That\\'s great, great. So do you have any questions    for us?\\nProspective nanny: Not really.\\nRachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...\\nRoss: Thank you.\\nRachel: Really nice to meet you... and we\\'ll call you.\\nProspective nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have    one question.  Do you guys do random drug    testing?\\nRoss: Boy, we uhm... hadn\\'t really thought of that.\\nProspective nanny: That\\'s cool. But... but if you do, I\\'m    gonna need three days notice.\\nRachel: Okidoki!  Wow! We\\'re never gonna find a nanny.\\nRoss: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews     And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider    the uhm... the first one we met with.\\nRachel:  What, the blonde with no bra?\\nRoss: She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one\\'s name is Sandy. She\\'s got a degree    in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three    years.\\nRachel: Okay...\\nSandy:  Hi... I\\'m Sandy.\\nRoss: And she\\'s a little mannish...\\nPhoebe:  Oh my God! David!\\nDavid: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?\\nPhoebe:  No! It\\'s a great time, come in...! WOW,    hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?\\nDavid: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I\\'m here to    explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it\\'s a positive thing that    we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.\\nPhoebe: Who cares, it got you here.\\nDavid: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got    on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your    address I... I... I didn\\'t even think about it.\\nPhoebe: Wow. Where is your luggage?\\nDavid: Damn it!\\nPhoebe: A-Allright, well... I\\'ll call the cab company.\\nDavid: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you    just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There\\'s an old Russian expression,    uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that    means uhm... This thing that I\\'m looking at: wow!\\nPhoebe: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually,    no, I look pretty good.\\nDavid: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don\\'t see    someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and    you start thinking about: Come on, don\\'t be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful,    but... well, you are.\\nPhoebe: No...\\nPhoebe: I\\'m... I\\'m just... I\\'m the worst person ever. How    can I not tell David that I\\'m seeing Mike?\\nMonica: Maybe he didn\\'t give you a chance.\\nPhoebe: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...\\nMonica: Oh, well... That had been your window.\\nPhoebe: Yeah! I mean, I don\\'t know. I was just , I was looking,    I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It\\'s David. David\\'s    here. He\\'s just, he\\'s so irresistible.\\nMonica: Really? The scientist guy?\\nPhoebe: Really? Chandler?\\nMonica: Continue...\\nPhoebe: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, \\'cause then I told him    that I would see him tomorrow night.\\nMonica: Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: I know!  Evil! And... and... and...    I like Mike so much, you know. It\\'s just going really well. Oh my God!\\nMonica: Wow, isn\\'t it ironic that David would show up on the    same day that you and Mike exchange keys?\\nPhoebe:  Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given    my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.\\nMonica: What are you gonna do?\\nPhoebe: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that    nothing can happen between us. Unless I don\\'t... You know, complicated    moral situation, no right, no wrong...\\nMonica: You have to tell David!\\nPhoebe: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation    with Joey.\\nChandler:\\nMonica: Heeeeeey!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nChandler: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they    call it the Sooner state. Frankly I\\'d sooner be in any other state.  And what\\'s with Oklahoma    having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I\\'m from    the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.\\nMonica:  Was your cabin    pressurised?\\nChandler:  And don\\'t get    me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nChandler: What\\'s with the word y\\'all? You know, just... two    words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,    I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried    chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I\\'ll have the fricken?  See, that\\'s... that\\'s funny with the fricken, right?\\nMonica: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today    at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?\\nChandler: Yeah, he came up...\\nMonica: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there,    but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.\\nChandler:  Were you there?\\nPhoebe: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...\\nSandy: I really do understand how hard it\\'s gotta be to leave    your child with another person. I mean, it\\'s leaving behind a piece of your    heart...\\nRachel: Sandy, that\\'s exactly what it is...\\nRoss: Are you gay?\\nRachel: Ross!\\nSandy: It\\'s okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I    am straight. I-I\\'m engaged actually.\\nRachel: Oh!\\nSandy: Her name is Deliah.\\nRachel: Oh, that\\'s pretty.\\nRoss:  So you\\'re just like a... guy who\\'s a nanny?\\nSandy: I realise how it\\'s... a bit unorthodox for some people,    but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is    take care of a child.\\nRoss:  Okay.\\nSandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three    weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person...    When I left, I said: I\\'ll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...\\nRoss: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.\\nRachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.\\nSandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...\\nRachel: Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him...\\nRoss: Oh, come on, Rach, he\\'s a guy!\\nRachel: So wh..? He\\'s smart, he\\'s qualified. Give me one good    reason we shouldn\\'t try him out.\\nRoss: Because, it\\'s weird!\\nRachel: Why?\\nRoss: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It\\'s    like if a woman wanted to be...\\nRachel:  Yes?\\nRoss: King?\\nSandy: I er... I hope you don\\'t mind. I used some of my home-made    lotion on Emma. It\\'s a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It\\'ll dry that    rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...\\nRachel:  YES! Sandy you\\'re hired.\\nSandy: That\\'s great!  I\\'m    sorry. It\\'s just... such an emotional thing when you\\'re welcomed into a new    family...\\nRachel: Oooh... ***I really can\\'t hear what she says*** come here.\\nRoss: You gotta be at least bi...\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nChandler: Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica    is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.\\nJoey: Ooh. I-I don\\'t know Chan. I\\'m not so good with remembering    lines.\\nChandler:  Well, thank God your    livelihood doesn\\'t depend on it.\\nJoey: I know, right?     Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?\\nChandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy    she\\'s ever met.\\nJoey: Seriously? She actually said that?\\nChandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?\\nJoey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!\\nChandler: Yeah!\\nJoey: Without that, you just got \"lame with women\".\\nChandler: Ye....\\nMonica: Hi! There you are.\\nJoey:\\nDavid: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.\\nPhoebe: Oof...\\nDavid: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.\\nPhoebe: Oh, wait, wait!\\nDavid: Yeah, I-I don\\'t, I can\\'t get away with stuff like that.    I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...\\nPhoebe: No, no, it\\'s not that.     Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well,    uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.\\nDavid: Oh... oh...\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.\\nDavid: No... well, yeah.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.\\nDavid: Well, i-it\\'s okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well,    are you happy with this guy?\\nPhoebe: I am happy.\\nDavid: Damn it! I-I\\'m sorry. I-I don\\'t mean that. I-I want    you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that\\'s not fair. Uh, who cares,    leave him!. Oh, I don\\'t mean that. Yes I do... I\\'m sorry Uhm, I... I think I    should probably uhm... go...\\nPhoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know    that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things    I\\'ve ever had to do.\\nDavid: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn\\'t exactly    a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?\\nPhoebe: Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss    on the cheek wouldn\\'t be totally inappropriate...\\nDavid: No... no...\\nPhoebe: I mean...\\nDavid: In Minsk...\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nDavid: ...it\\'s uhm... i-it\\'s two on each cheek and uhm...    and one on the lips.\\nPhoebe: Well, if that\\'s what they do in Minsk...\\nRachel:  Hi...\\nRoss:  Is everything allright?\\nRachel: Oh yeah, it\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Sandy was just... was    just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just    sooo beautiful.\\nSandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the    poem...\\nRachel: I can\\'t... I can\\'t hear it again.\\nSandy: You know, I can\\'t tell it again...\\nRoss: And I\\'m fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see    you for a sec?\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nRoss: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three    times...? Huh? I haven\\'t cried that many times since I moved in.\\nRachel: Look, Ross, he\\'s just... Sandy is just sensitive,    that\\'s all.\\nRoss:\\nRachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?\\nRoss:  These are amazing!\\nRachel: Sandy made Madeleines.\\nRoss: This... this is exactly what I\\'m talking about. What    kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They\\'re not even...    butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.\\nRachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don\\'t know what to say...    I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.    You know, \\'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in    from branding cattle.\\nRoss: Hey... there\\'s sensitive... and there is too sensitive.\\nRachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive?\\nPhoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can\\'t do this. It\\'s bad.\\nDavid: But... I-I-It\\'s nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and    good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.\\nPhoebe: No, no. No.\\nDavid: But... ergo...\\nPhoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah,    we\\'d probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I\\'m with    Mike and I really care about him...\\nDavid: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul...    ui...\\nMike: Well... hey, the key works...!\\nPhoebe:  And you thanks for the    face massage. Thank you.\\nRoss: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?\\nMonica: Yeah! I think that\\'s great!\\nRoss: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites    poetry and bakes Madeleines?\\nMonica: Oh... How are they?\\nRoss:\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRoss: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.\\nJoey:  Really...? Guys do that...? That\\'s...    weird...\\nRoss: Thank you!\\nJoey: That\\'s like a woman wanting to be a...\\nRoss: ...a what? A what? What\\'s the end of that sentence?\\nMonica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?\\nJoey: Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler    that some guy from work is the funniest guy you\\'ve ever met?\\nMonica: Yeah, so?\\nRoss: Wow!\\nJoey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?\\nMonica: Is that why he\\'s acting so weird...? He\\'s jealous...?    Oh my God, that is crazy. It\\'s not like I\\'m attracted to Geoffrey...\\nJoey: So what? Being funny is Chandler\\'s thing...    You know, like Ross\\'s thing is...\\nRoss: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?\\nJoey: ...No...\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe he\\'s that upset about this...\\nJoey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay.    \\'Cause he\\'s feeling like...\\nChandler: Hey!\\nJoey: Heeeyy! Hey!\\nChandler: What are you guys talking about?\\nRoss: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.\\nChandler: You got a man who\\'s a nanny...? You got a manny...?\\nChandler: You know, I don\\'t mind a... male nanny, but I do    draw the line at a male wetnurse.\\nMonica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!\\nChandler: If I\\'d known you guys were coming over, I would    have brought more pizza.\\nMonica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!\\nChandler: What is so funny about that?\\nMonica: Well, I don\\'t know... I-It\\'s... just the way you say    it... I mean, you\\'re funny... You have that funny thing. You\\'re a funny guy!\\nChandler: Did you tell her what we talked about?\\nJoey: Yeah....\\nChandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?\\nMonica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with    Geoffrey.\\nChandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?\\nMonica: Well, you\\'re... you\\'re different funny... I mean,    you\\'re... you\\'re more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions...    and... and limericks...\\nChandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named    Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.\\nMonica: Honey, you know I think you\\'re hilarious! Come on,    you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the    girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me.\\nRoss: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!\\nJoey: Not knowing when to shut up...\\nRoss: Yep! That\\'s my thing...\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nMike: So... how many guys have your key?\\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no, no... It\\'s not... it\\'s not... i\\'ts    not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.\\nMike: Your lipstick\\'s on his mouth.\\nDavid: Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.\\nPhoebe: No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years    ago, and he lives in Minsk. He\\'s only... he\\'s only in town for a couple of days.\\nMike: Did you uhm...\\nPhoebe: No, no...\\nMike: ...kiss him?\\nPhoebe: Oh, well, yeah...\\nDavid: Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes    you. I-In fact I-I-I don\\'t think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.\\nMike: Don\\'t point your finger at me.\\nDavid: Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?\\nMike: Well... I\\'ll... just show you what I\\'m gonna do about    it...\\nPhoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!     Here David, you    should just go.\\nDavid: Allright... But... if I ever do come back    from Minsk...  well, you just better watch out.\\nMike: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you\\'d    better watch out.\\nDavid: Oh, you\\'re going to Minsk?\\nMike: Well, I might.\\nDavid: Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It\\'s just    lovely there.\\nPhoebe: Okay, well... guys?\\nDavid: Right... Goodbye Phoebe.\\nMike: Hey, what are you kidding me?\\nDavid: Right-o, right-o...\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry, I\\'m so sorry. If you... If you want your    key back, I totally understand.\\nMike: It\\'s never gonna happen again right?\\nPhoebe: Right! Never! Never! I swear!\\nDavid: I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever    come to Minsk, that\\'s my number\\nJoey: Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught    me Hot-cross Buns.\\nRoss: Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.\\nJoey: Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...\\nRoss:\\nSandy: Who\\'s up for puppets?\\nJoey: Me! I\\'m up for puppets!\\nSandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants    to be mr. Wigglemunch and who\\'s gonna be the Grumpus?\\nRoss: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed    to appreciate puppets?\\nSandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours    help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.\\nJoey: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.\\nRoss:  Oh my God!\\nSandy: Well, I guess we know who\\'s gonna be the Grumpus...\\nRachel: That was kind of rude!\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'m sorry.

I-I\\'m sorry I\\'m the only one    who isn\\'t in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can\\'t... I    can\\'t go through with this.\\nRachel: Oh, come on Ross...\\nRoss: No! Hey, you know what? I\\'m sorry. I would never force    you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...\\nRachel:  Oh... That\\'s true.\\nRoss: Thank you!\\nRachel: Well, you\\'re the one who wants to fire him, so you\\'re    gonna have to do it.\\nSandy:  So you see Wigglemunch, that\\'s    why it\\'s important to shaaaaaaare...\\nJoey:  I am learning so much from you.\\nChandler: Well, I\\'m off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend    has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.\\nMonica: Honey, you can relax.

Last night he had me laughing    so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.\\nRoss: Here goes...\\nRachel: I can\\'t watch. It\\'s like firing Elmo.\\nRoss: Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I\\'m afraid    it\\'s not working out.\\nSandy:  Oh...\\nRoss: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great...    with Emma... uhm... We just feel...\\nRachel:  YOU! You feel!\\nRoss: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn\\'t right.    I\\'m sorry. We\\'re... we\\'re more than happy to give you good recommendation...\\nSandy: Oh, no, no, no... That\\'s okay. I got a lot of offers    from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.\\nRachel:  Oh, damn you Geller!\\nRoss: Anyway, uhm...Well, I\\'m glad there\\'s no hard feelings.\\nSandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever    is in your home... Although if you don\\'t mind telling me, what was your problem?    Maybe it\\'s something I can work on in the future.\\nRoss: No, you know, it\\'s uhm... nothing you did, it\\'s... it\\'s    uhm... my issue.\\nSandy: What is it...?\\nRoss: You know, I\\'m just not uhm... that comfortable with    a guy who\\'s as sensitive as you.\\nSandy: That\\'s fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think    that is?\\nRoss: Why... I... I don\\'t know.     Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?\\nSandy: hmmm...\\nRoss: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was    kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn\\'t the athlete I am now.\\nRachel:  Huh ha ha!\\nRoss: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get    the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.\\nSandy: That must have been hard.\\nRoss: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom...    playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father    walks in and says... he says... \"What are you doing with those things?    What\\'s wrong with you, why aren\\'t you... why aren\\'t you outside playing like    a... like a real boy?\\nSandy: But you are a real boy!\\nRoss: I know I am!  ...And when it\\'s    summer, and it\\'s hot, why can\\'t you wear a tank top?\\nSandy: It\\'s allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos    out.\\nRoss: Here come some more...\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nSandy/Grumpus: And what\\'s the one kind of boat that can never,    ever sink?\\nJoey/Wigglemunch: What kind?\\nSandy/Grumpus: A friend-ship...\\nJoey: Wow! You blow my mind...\\nSandy: Oh, I gotta go.\\nJoey: Aaahh... How much do I owe you?\\nSandy: Twenty bucks.\\nJoey: It\\'s like the cheapest college ever.\\nEND\\n======== 09-07\\nWritten by: Robert Carlock   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug\\nDedicated to the great work of Eric Aasen, Guineapig and many, many more.\\nRoss: And that\\'s why, no matter what mommy says, we really    were on a break.     I\\'m a terrible father!\\nOPENING CREDITS\\nChandler: Hi!\\nJoey: Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?\\nChandler: How come?\\nJoey: Well, I\\'m starting to make good money on the show and    I\\'m thinking... I should probably do something with it.\\nMonica: What do you do with your money now?\\nJoey: Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.     I didn\\'t say that! It\\'s in    a bank guarded by robots!\\nChandler: Do you have any ideas?\\nJoey: Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going    in on an emu farm. That\\'d be kinda cool huh? Pitchin\\' in on the weekends, helping    to plant the emus...\\nMonica: Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.\\nJoey:\\nMonica: Joey, I think you should consider something a little    less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The    Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.     That\\'s right, I know some stuff!\\nJoey: Real estate, huh? Hmmm...\\nMonica:  Oh, and you know who\\'s selling a great    apartment? Richard!\\nChandler:  Oh, and you know whose knowledge    of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!\\nMonica: My dad told me. They play golf together.\\nChandler: Oh, well... Maybe I\\'ll join them some time. I just    hope the club doesn\\'t slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.\\nPhoebe: Hi!\\nRachel and Monica: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Listen! You have to help me pick a dress \\'cause I\\'m    meeting Mike\\'s parents tonight!\\nMonica: Wow, the boyfriend\\'s parents! That\\'s a big step.\\nPhoebe:  Really? That hadn\\'t occurred to me.\\nMonica: They just gonna love you, just be yourself.\\nPhoebe: They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!\\nRachel: Oh yeah, she can\\'t be herself.\\nPhoebe: Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say \"neither\".\\nRachel and Monica: Oh God, neither!\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry honey, but we\\'re gonna take you shopping.    It\\'s gonna be fine.\\nRachel: Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I\\'m    so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a    little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: \"Oh mr. Pincer,    I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...\"\\nMonica: You went out with Wallis Pincer?\\nRachel: Uh, he took the SAT\\'s for me.\\nMonica: I knew you didn\\'t get a 1400!\\nRachel: Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...\\nPhoebe: So... now... What about with Mike\\'s mom?\\nRachel: Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell    her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross\\'s mom one time    actually said I\\'m like the daughter that she never had.\\nMonica:   She said WHAT?\\nPhoebe:\\nRachel: Hi.\\nRoss: Hi.\\nRachel: I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet    Mike\\'s parents. She\\'s so nervous, it\\'s so sweet!\\nRoss: Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.\\nRachel:  You WHAT? And I missed it? Because    I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?\\nRoss: Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person    laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...     Only... only not creepy.\\nRachel: Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?\\nRoss: I uhm... Well, I sang...\\nRachel: You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song    about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?\\nRoss: But you know what, if you think about it, it actually    promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm...    juicy doubles.\\nRachel:  owwwww...\\nRoss: Please don\\'t take her away from me!\\nCatherine: Oh hi, come on in. I\\'m Catherine, the listing agent.\\nJoey: Hi I\\'m Joey. This is Chandler.\\nChandler: So how come Richard\\'s selling the place? Went bankrupt?    Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?\\nCatherine: Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It\\'s    got a great view of Central Pa.....\\nChandler: mmm That\\'s enough about you!\\nJoey: Is there anything we should know about the apartment?\\nCatherine: All the appliances are included. There is a lot    of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...\\nChandler: No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we\\'re not together.    We\\'re not a couple. We\\'re definately not a couple.\\nCatherine: Oh... Okay, sorry!\\nJoey: Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I\\'m not    good enough for you?\\nChandler: We\\'re not gonna have this conversation again...    Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this    huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about    losing Monica to a real man!\\nJoey: You know what it is? It\\'s a nice place but I gotta see    I don\\'t know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah,    I could see it.\\nChandler:  Look at these videos. You know, I mean,    who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my    God!\\nJoey: What?\\nChandler: There\\'s a tape here with Monica\\'s name on it.\\nJoey: Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It\\'s probably a    sex tape...\\nChandler: Get there faster!\\nMike: Wow! You look like... like my mom.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m wearing pantyhose!\\nMike: Great! Come on in!\\nPhoebe: Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you\\'re RICH!\\nMike: No, my parents are rich.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, so... They gotta die someday.  HELLO!\\nMike: Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents:    Theodore and Bitsy.\\nPhoebe:  Theodore... Bitsy... What    a delight!\\nBitsy: It\\'s so nice to finally meet you!\\nPhoebe: And you... Your home is lovely.\\nBitsy: Well thank you, I\\'ll give you a tour later. It\\'s actually    three floors.\\nPhoebe: Holy crap!\\nBitsy: Phoebe, why don\\'t you come in the living room and meet    our friends?\\nPhoebe: Oh, try and stop me!\\nMike: Hey... Wh... What are you doing?\\nPhoebe:  I\\'m trying to get your parents to like    me.\\nMike: Yeah, I\\'m sure they will, but you don\\'t have to do this...    I\\'m wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not  Phoebe...\\nPhoebe:  Got it! It... It\\'s hard to stop...\\nMike: Well, come on...\\nTheodore: Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.\\nBitsy: Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself...    So where are you from?\\nPhoebe:  So...    where does everyone summer?\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nPhoebe: God! God! This is not going well.\\nMike: No, no, no, you\\'re doing fine, really... Why don\\'t you    go talk to my dad?\\nPhoebe: Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being    myself?\\nMike: Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.\\nPhoebe: So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets    his good looks from...\\nTheodore: Oh... Well...\\nPhoebe: Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the    time...\\nTheodore: Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...\\nPhoebe: Yeah I bet! Look out!\\nTheodore: OH! OWWWWW!\\nPhoebe: Oh my God, are you okay?\\nTheodore: I recently had surgery.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m so sorry!\\nTheodore: No, I\\'ll be fine... I just should check the stitches...\\nPhoebe: I really, really am sorry.\\nTheodore: How could you know. Why wouldn\\'t you punch me in    the stomach?\\nMike: Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?\\nPhoebe: Yes... I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve never met a boyfriends parents    before...\\nMike: But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look,    why don\\'t you go talk to my mom?\\nPhoebe: Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice,    I can talk to her.\\nMike: Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of    internal bleeding.\\nPhoebe: Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted    to thank you again for having me here tonight.\\nBitsy: Well, not at all...\\nPhoebe: Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful    man your son is.\\nBitsy: Thank you, I think so too.\\nPhoebe: Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how    he was raised. Especially to you. Because he\\'s very respectful of women.\\nBitsy: Is he really?\\nPhoebe: Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings    and... you know I think... you\\'d also like to know that he is a very gentle    lover.\\nBitsy: E-e-excuse me?\\nPhoebe:  Oh no,    no, no, no, no, no. Don\\'t get me wrong. No, he\\'s not in like a sissy way. No,    no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...\\nBitsy: That\\'s... my boy.\\nMike: Awesome!\\nChandler: I\\'m not gonna watch it... I don\\'t NEED to watch    it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?\\nJoey: Hey dude, what\\'s up?\\nChandler: Don\\'t judge me, I\\'m only human!\\nJoey: Did you take that tape?\\nChandler: I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and    you found a tape of your wife in another guys\\' apartment... Wouldn\\'t you need    to know what was on it?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know. Who\\'m I\\'m married to?\\nChandler: Some girl...!?\\nJoey: She hot?\\nChandler: Yeah...!?\\nJoey: How did she get me to settle down?\\nChandler: Allright, I\\'m gonna watch it... I mean look, it\\'s    probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can\\'t possibly    be as bad as what I\\'m picturing in my head...  Can it?\\nJoey: Guess I don\\'t know. My experience: if a girl says yes    to being taped... She doesn\\'t say no to much else, I tell ya...\\nChandler: Then you\\'re gonna have to watch it for me.\\nJoey:  What? Whoo... What?\\nChandler: Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is...    Please?\\nJoey: All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only    yourself to blame...\\nChandler: Why am I hearing cheering?\\nJoey: Well it\\'s okay, its like... its just a football game.\\nChandler: Football? Just football?\\nJoey: Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.\\nChandler: It\\'s football... It\\'s just football... This is great!    This is the first time I\\'ve ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to    get a beer...     What are you doing?\\nJoey: You don\\'t wanna see what I just saw!\\nMonica: What are you guys doing?\\nRachel: Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please?    Please laugh for mommy...\\nRoss: Hey!\\nRachel: Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing.    It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...\\nRoss: Oh I know, isn\\'t it? Ooh... what\\'d you do to get her    to laugh?\\nRachel: Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ...    I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...\\nRoss: You sang Baby Got Back didn\\'t you?\\nRachel: Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...\\nPhoebe: ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly    cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t\\'s not your fau-lt. And that\\'s the end of the song...    I realise that you didn\\'t ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen    minutes.\\nMike: Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that    one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?\\nPhoebe: Oh, Pervert Parade?\\nMike:  No...\\nPhoebe: Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?\\nMike: Stop!\\nPhoebe: Oh God! Is that veal?\\nMike: Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe\\'s a vegetarian.\\nBitsy: Oh!\\nPhoebe: Oh no, no, no, no... That\\'s okay, that\\'s okay... I    mean, I\\'m... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...\\nMike: Phoebe you don\\'t have to eat...\\nPhoebe: No, no, no, I actually it\\'s any baby animals: kittens,    fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat    running through it...\\nMike: So...? What do you think?\\nMonica: So you stole that tape from Richard\\'s apartment?\\nChandler: Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn    star!\\nMonica: That tape was never meant to be seen by...     Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.\\nJoey:\\nMonica: Why in the world would you take this tape and and    why would you watch it?\\nChandler: Because that\\'s who I am, okay? I\\'m sure a mature    man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn\\'t bother him. Just\\'d    be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men\\'s club over brandy and    moustaches.\\nMonica: Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?\\nChandler: This is about you and Richard. He\\'s clearly not    over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.\\nMonica: Isn\\'t that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that    is? You shouldn\\'t be jealous. You should feel bad for him.\\nChandler: Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y\\'... I can grow a    moustache!\\nMonica: Chandler, this is not our problem. We\\'ve got each    other. That\\'s all that matters.\\nChandler: Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling    around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...\\nMonica: Cowboy boots? I\\'ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole    life!\\nChandler: Oh, good, good. Play more, \\'cause I wanna see how    it ends.\\nMonica: THAT\\'S NOT ME!\\nChandler: What...? That\\'s not you! Life is good again! Ride    \\'em cowgirl!\\nMonica: That bastard taped over me!\\nChandler: Is that a problem?\\nMonica: I-It\\'s just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank    tape, Doctor!\\nTheodore: I can\\'t imagine what he sees in her.\\nBitsy: She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife    of his.  Oh, hello dear...\\nMike: Hey, what\\'s going on?\\nBitsy: We were just chit-chatting. How\\'s your friend?\\nMike: A little better.\\nBitsy: By the way, do you know who\\'s moving back into town?    Tom and Sue\\'s daughter Jen.\\nTheodore: You remember her Michael, she\\'s lovely and... well    behaved and... single.\\nMike: I\\'m not interested.\\nBitsy: Oh, please darling, let\\'s be honest. You can have all    the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let\\'s be real...\\nMike: All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight    is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn\\'t been clear all the time,    but she did her best. And yeah... She\\'s a little different than you are...\\nBitsy: Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!\\nMike: So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn\\'t    bother you. And you don\\'t have to like her. You just have to accept    the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can\\'t be civil to the woman I love...\\nBitsy: The woman you what?\\nPhoebe: Yeah... The woman you what?\\nMike: The woman I love...  I love you...    Which is probably something I shouldn\\'t say for the first time in front of my    parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I\\'ve    ever met in my life...\\nPhoebe: I love you too...\\nMike: You do?\\nPhoebe: YEAH...! How great is this...?\\nMike: Wanna get out of here?\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nMike: Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.\\nPhoebe: I had a great time.  It was really top drawer.    And here\\'s something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in    the coat closet... Ta taaa...\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nRoss: She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo \\'vette.\\nRachel: So fellas\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nRachel: fellas\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nRachel: has your girlfriend got the butt?\\nRoss: Hell yeah!\\nRachel: So shake it!\\nRoss: Shake it!\\nRachel: Shake it!\\nRoss: Shake it!\\nRachel: Shake that nasty butt...\\nRoss: Baby got back\\nRachel: One more time from the top... I like big butts    and I cannot lie, you other br...\\nRoss: Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!\\nEND\\n======== 09-08\\nMonica: Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?\\nChandler: Yeah. Hey, here\\'s an idea, why don\\'t we use our   wedding china today?\\nMonica: No, I think we should save our china for something   really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.\\nChandler: Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.\\nMonica: What if something gets broken, they\\'re so expensive.\\nChandler: What is the point of having them if we never use   them?\\nMonica: Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen   comes over..\\nChandler: I will explain it to her.\\nMonica:  Oh yeah, like I\\'m going to let you   talk to the queen.\\nJoey: wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those   horses can crap.\\nTV announcer: Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.\\nChandler: Muskogee! That\\'s like four hours from Tulsa. Woo   hoo!   TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap   Days of Our Lives .\\nJoey: Oh my God!\\nChandler: Aren\\'t you one of the stars of the popular daytime   soap Days of Our Lives?\\nJoey: Yeah! I totally forgot I\\'m supposed to be there. I   can\\'t believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.\\n   Oh! Stupid long sleeves.\\nChandler: What are you going to do?\\nJoey: I guess I\\'m going to have to come up with a really   good reason why I wasn\\'t there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.   They sat us all down yesterday and said \"Everyone has to be there at 6:00   AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani.\" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.\\nChandler: Well you proved them wrong.\\nJoey nods: Yeah.\\nOpening Credits\\nRoss and Rachels Apartment\\nRachel to Emma: Oh Emma.

But you are much cuter then that geeky guy   she used to date.\\nRoss: That was me.\\nAmy: No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had   this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.\\nRoss with a look of wondering how long this is going to go on on his face:   Still me.\\nAmy: No, I\\'m not talking about you.  It   was your fat    friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?\\nRoss starts talking over her \\'do you remember\\' line: Amy. I\\'m going to save   you some time, ok.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\nJoey: Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs!\\nPhoebe: Hey, what\\'s going on Joe?\\nJoey: I.. I.. I need a good lie.\\nPhoebe: Oh okay. How about the whole \"man walking on   the moon\" thing. You know? You. you could.

You stink at lying.\\nJoey: I do not.\\nPhoebe: Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday   at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin   was gone-who took it?\\nJoey: Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a   raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said \"Hey   don\\'t eat that-that\\'s Phoebe\\'s\" and he said..  He said.. \"Joey   you stink at lying.\" What am I going to do?\\nPhoebe: Don\\'t worry, don\\'t worry. We\\'ll come up with a good   lie. I\\'ll help you practice it.\\nJoey: Oh great, that\\'d be great. Thank you.\\nPhoebe: Sure, what.. what was the work thing?\\nJoey: Uh..\\nPhoebe: \"Pick up grandma at the airport\"?\\nJoey: Oh.. man..\\nRoss and Rachel\\'s Apartment.\\nAmy with straight hair: Oh she\\'s precious.

Ross has a PhD.\\nAmy: Ew.\\nRachel: God she is unbelievable.\\nRoss: I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.\\nRachel: Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a   restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.\\nAmy storms out: Stupid Thanksgiving.\\nRachel: What? What happened?\\nAmy: My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find   a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then   his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married   guys.\\nRoss: Don\\'t say that.\\nAmy: Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to   be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.\\nRachel: Oh Amy, don\\'t cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk   to you in private?\\nRoss: Sure, you want to go upstairs?\\nRachel: Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I   would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.\\nRoss: You know, I think thats a great idea. It\\'ll be like   the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.\\nRachel: Look I know she\\'s a little tough to take. She has   no where else to go, and she\\'s my sister. Alright, she\\'s Emma\\'s aunt. And I   would like them to bond.\\nRoss: Ok, fine, but I don\\'t want them bonding to much. I   don\\'t want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.\\nRachel: Ross, you know what? She may need one..We\\'re just   going to have to make our peace with that!\\nMonica and Chandler\\'s apartment\\nRachel opens their door: Hi.\\nEveryone there says: Hi, hey.\\nRachel: Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.

That\\'s a funny noise.\\nJoey: Pheebs, I still need some help here\\nPhoebe: Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.   but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when   you\\'re talking, people know you\\'re lying.\\nJoey: Oh.. I don\\'t know why this is so hard for me. you know..   I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.\\nPhoebe looks down: You are a terrific actor.\\nAmy coming out of the bathroom: Hey. Hey where\\'s the baby?\\nRachel: Oh we just put her down for a nap.\\nAmy: Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?   If you guys died.\\nRoss first has a look of \\'huh\\' then changes it to sarcastic happy: Thank you   Amy.\\nAmy: no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it   would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn\\'t know what to do with her,   then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then   I\\'d get married.\\nPhoebe: Thats a great movie.\\nAmy: Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything   cause you know you\\'d be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I\\'m just   not really a big fan of Emily.\\nRoss: Emma.\\nAmy turns around to Phoebe: Emma, Ross wants you.\\nPhoebe: PHOE-BE.\\nAmy turns to Ross and Rachel: Why does she keep making that   noise?\\nRachel: Honey, I don\\'t know how to tell you this, but um,   if something were to happen to Ross or to myself  um you wouldn\\'t get the baby.\\nAmy: Well who would?\\nRoss: Well we haven\\'t offically asked them yet, but we would   want Monica and Chandler.\\nChandler: I can\\'t believe you\\'d want us to raise Emma.\\nMonica: yeah oh my god, I\\'m so moved.\\nAmy: I don\\'t believe this, hold on a second. You guys die   and I don\\'t get your baby?\\nRachel: See look Amy, we\\'re a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.   We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don\\'t seem very connected   to the baby.\\nAmy: Connected? I mean.. to what? She\\'s.. she\\'s a lump.\\nChandler: You know, guys I got to say. This means so much   to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica   and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I\\'ve had my doubts   about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....\\nAmy:  This guy? Seriously?\\nLater in the day.\\nMonica: Okay! It\\'s time for dinner. Everyone we\\'re using   our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.\\nRoss starts playing with a plate: Woah. Woah...  Woah.\\nMonica: Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will   not be well recieved.\\nRoss makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.\\nJoey: Hey! How come my plate\\'s less fancy then everyone else\\'s?   Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?\\nMonica: No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.\\nJoey: I can\\'t believe I won.\\nAmy: Its such a slap in the face. I\\'m your sister and you   would give your baby to these strangers over me.\\nRachel: Monica is Ross\\' sister.\\nAmy: No, Ross\\' sister was really fat.\\nMonica: That was me.\\nAmy: No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that   used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.\\nRachel: Hey. Amy. You\\'ve got to stop doing that.\\nMonica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you\\'re having a little   bit of a family crisis, but you don\\'t have to take it out on the plates. I   mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.\\nMonica: Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets   face it you have fun.\\nAmy: Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate   lady dies, then do I get the baby?\\nChandler: No, if crazy plate lad..  If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?\\nRachel: Well actually...\\nChandler: Actually what?\\nRoss: well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma   would go to my parents.\\nChandler: What?\\nAmy: Hurts, doesn\\'t it?\\nJoey raises his hand: Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?\\nCommercial Break.\\nChandler: So if Monica\\'s not around, then I\\'m not good enough   to raise Emma?\\nRoss looks down: No, that that is not what we\\'re saying.\\nJoey: Yeah he\\'s lying. He looked down.\\nChandler: Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?   Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!\\nRachel: Honey, you\\'re taking this the wrong way. We think   you\\'re going to be a wonderful parent. It\\'s just.. you\\'re more the fun parent.\\nRoss: Yeah and we\\'d want to make sure Emma has someone like   Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.\\nMonica: Thats not how you see me, is it?\\nPhoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you\\'re all about the fun.\\nChandler: Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do   you really think I\\'m not capable?\\nRoss: No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you\\'re   strongest when.. when you\\'re together.\\nChandler: Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die  she\\'d have to give her up.\\nRoss: Sure, Monica would have to give her up.\\nJoey: I lie better then that, right?\\nChandler: So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends   die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left   in my life gets taken away from me?\\nPhoebe: There\\'s your movie!\\nLater on.\\nMonica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.\\nMonica: Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.\\nChandler: Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise   poorly?\\nMonica: Ross and Rachel don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about.   I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of   Merlot and a five year old condom.\\nChandler: Yeah but they\\'re right. I mean, I\\'m not a strong   father figure and I never will be.\\nMonica: No you learn these things. You grow into it.\\nChandler: Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said   was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody   knows it.\\nMonica: I don\\'t know it! I want to have a kid with you because   I think you\\'re going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard   parts.\\nChandler: Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go   to your room! You\\'re grounded\"?\\nMonica: Can you hear me say \"You\\'re grounded\"?\\nChandler: You said that to me last week.\\nMonica: How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.\\nBack to Monica and Chandler\\'s apartment.\\nAmy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.\\nJoey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message   on my machine asking why I wasn\\'t at the parade. They said everybody\\'s pissed   off at me..  And they all got to meet Santa!\\nPhoebe: It\\'s ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It\\'s   easy to remember and doesn\\'t invite a lot of questions. You weren\\'t at the   parade because you had a family emergency.\\nJoey: Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn\\'t at the parade because   I had a family emergency.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, what happened?\\nJoey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister\\'s   raccoon.\\nPhoebe: No! Nothing with a raccoon.\\nJoey: Arg... Alright, I\\'ll take care of it.\\nMonica and Chandler come through the front door.\\nMonica: Oh wait.. What are you doing?\\nJoey: Setting the table.\\nPhoebe: Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy   china for dessert too.\\nMonica: Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses   on my wedding dress.\\nRoss comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying   thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.\\nRoss: Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.\\nChandler: Oh no thats okay, you\\'re totally right. I don\\'t   know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I   want you to know that when I die, you don\\'t get Joey.\\nRoss walks away with a face of yeah ok.\\nAmy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch.  In case you hadn\\'t noticed, I\\'m not talking to you.\\nRachel: UCHH!\\nAmy: You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.\\nRachel: Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when   I died and didn\\'t give you my baby?\\nAmy: This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I   mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.\\nRachel: What? What carrer?\\nAmy: Um.. I\\'m a decorator.\\nRachel: Ok. You decorate dad\\'s office and so now you\\'re a   decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I\\'m a koala bear.\\nAmy: Why can\\'t you ever be supportive?\\nRachel: Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn\\'t even   come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.\\nAmy: Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn\\'t come see me when I was in   the hospital when I was getting my lips done.\\nRachel: I did the first time! Oh. Oh..  And you know what. You want to know why I\\'m not giving   Emily to you.\\nRoss: Emma.\\nRachel turns to Ross: Oh whose side are you on?  I\\'m not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle   the responibility of a child.\\nAmy: How hard could it be? You do it.\\nJoey: ooh oooh..\\nAmy: Do you want to know why you don\\'t want me to have   the baby?\\nRachel: uh huh.\\nAmy: Because you don\\'t want me to be happy. You.. you have   always been jealous of me.\\nRachel: Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,   your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people\\'s feelings?\\nAmy: Uh.. To name a few. You know.. You know.. You\\'ve   just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn\\'t   have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do   you even realize how much that hurt me?\\nRachel: Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!\\nAmy: Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.\\nRachel: I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here   today.\\nAmy: Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called   sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.\\nRachel: ah ha ha. ah ha ha.  It\\'s   forty five.\\nAmy: You bitch. You just think you\\'re so perfect. With your   new baby and your, your small apartment.  Well let me tell you something.   Your baby isn\\'t even that cute.\\nRoss walks over: Too far, Amy. Too far.\\nRachel: You take that back.\\nAmy: No.\\nRachel: Take it back!\\nAmy: No! What are you going to do? Make me?\\nRachel: Heey man, I work out.\\nAmy: So do I.\\nRachel: I do pilates.\\nAmy: I do yoga.\\nRachel: Bring it on!\\nMonica: Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the   boxes!\\nRachel: Did you just push me?\\nAmy: Uh, yeah I think I did.\\nRachel: Alright. Thats it!\\nMonica screaming at Ross: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn\\'t   time!\\nRachel starts messing up Amy\\'s hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!\\nPhoebe: Oh my god! Shouldn\\'t we stop this?\\nJoey: What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello   on them.\\nRachel: Ew! Gross.\\nChandler: Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and   you can not behave this way. Now if you can\\'t act your age then you shouldn\\'t   be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones   I picked out, but they\\'re very important to Monica. I want you to apologize   to her right now.\\nAmy: I\\'m sorry.\\nRachel: Mon, I\\'m so sorry.\\nChandler: Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize   to each other and mean it.\\nAmy and Rachel at same time: Sorry.\\nChandler: By the way, that fight was totally arousing.\\nRoss: Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel   dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.\\nChandler: Oh yeah? Well thanks.\\nRoss: So, so now do I get Joey?\\nChandler: Okay, but you should know he eats five times a   day and shoves pennies up his nose.\\nRachel: Are you okay Mon?\\nMonica: uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its\\' just a   plate. Its not like somebody died.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s all right. You can mourn.\\nMonica starts crying: Thank you. It was so beautiful.  I\\'m going to go to Joeys and get the pies.\\nJoey: Actually its not pies, its just pie.\\nMonica: I don\\'t care.  Oh my   god. I\\'ve lost the will to scold.\\nRachel: Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I\\'m   sorry. You\\'re my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..\\nAmy: So you\\'re going to give me the baby?\\nRachel: Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren   discount.\\nAmy starting to cry: You are not going to regret this.\\nRachel: She needs changing.\\nChandler: Oh no no no.. I\\'ll get her. I\\'m super-compentent   and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I\\'ll be right there   Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here.  Well.. what do you know? I guess, I\\'ll be the one who dies first.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nPhoebe: Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?\\nChandler: Nope...\\nPhoebe: Broke them all, huh?\\nChandler: Yep...\\nPhoebe: You gonna tell her?\\nChandler: Nope...  Hey... so I\\'m gonna...   put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don\\'t think we should   use these plates again for a looong time.\\nMonica: Like only if the queen comes?\\nChandler: Maybe not even then.\\nJoey: Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had   a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie   Pheebs.\\nPhoebe: No problem! Next week: stealing...\\nMonica: Bye plates!\\nJoey: Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?\\nMonica: What? Something happened with the plates?\\nJoey: Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came   in...\\n======== 09-09\\nDirected by: Ben Weiss   Written by: Mark Kunerth   Transcript by: David Buehrle\\nJO LYNN: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy    in the cat condo is Jinkies.\\nCHANDLER: Yep.

Where\\'s your crazy assistant?\\nCHANDLER: What\\'s up Joe?\\nJOEY: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?\\nCHANDLER: Braid each other\\'s hair and ride horseback on the beach?\\nJOEY: No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to    be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!\\nCHANDLER: Courtside? Oh my God.\\nJOEY: Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with    his knee.\\nCHANDLER: That\\'s so cool. I\\'ll let Monica know.\\nMONICA: Hello?\\nCHANDLER: Joey just called. He\\'s got courtside Knicks tickets for him and    me tomorrow night.\\nMONICA: Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.    If you go to the game, we won\\'t have a night together for another week.\\nCHANDLER: But hey, it\\'s courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right    in fr. . .  That\\'s not the way to convince you.\\nMONICA: Chandler look, I don\\'t want to be one of those wives who says, \"You    can\\'t go to the game. You have to spend time with me.\" So, if you could just    realize it on your own . . .\\nCHANDLER: I know. You\\'re right. I want to see you too. I\\'ve just got to    figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He\\'s really looking forward to this.\\nMONICA: Tell him that you haven\\'t seen your wife in a long time. Tell him    that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that    what little time we have is precious.\\nCHANDLER: Yeah, ah, ah . . . I\\'ll think of something.\\nROSS: Wow!  Wow, You look . . . uh . . . It\\'s just, ah . . . That    dress . . . uh . . .\\nRACHEL: Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.\\nROSS: Well, well, they\\'re good. It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve seen you like    this. You, you clean up good.\\nRACHEL: Oh well, well thank you.\\nROSS: Oh right, right.  So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night    away from Emma?\\nRACHEL: Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank    you for watching the baby, by the way.\\nROSS: Oh, it\\'s fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.\\nRACHEL: Phoebe\\'s Mike?\\nROSS: Yeah.\\nRACHEL: I didn\\'t know you guys hung out.\\nROSS: We don\\'t. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know,    maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.\\nRACHEL: Oh that\\'s so cute: Ross and Mike\\'s first date. Is that going to be    awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?\\nROSS: I don\\'t know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.    He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He\\'s been divorced; I have some    experience in that area.\\nRACHEL: Yeah.\\nPHOEBE: Hi\\nRACHEL: Hey.\\nPHOEBE:  Oooh. Girl\\'s night out indeed.\\nRACHEL:  Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,    but if you need anything Ross . . .\\nROSS: Rach, Rach, we\\'ll be fine, all right? You go have fun.\\nRACHEL: Okay. You too. And I hope you score.  Bye.\\nMIKE: Bye.\\nROSS: So . . . Welcome.\\nMIKE:  I got beer.\\nROSS: I got bottled breast milk.\\nMIKE: Eh, why don\\'t we start with the beer?\\nROSS: Okay.  So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.\\nMIKE: Yeah.\\nROSS: You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.\\nMIKE: Ah?  Do you have one here?\\nROSS: No.\\nMIKE: Okay.\\nROSS: Um . . . ah . . . you know, I\\'m divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe    said you . . . You\\'ve been divorced?\\nMIKE: Yeah.  Yeah, I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t . . . I don\\'t really like to    talk about it.\\nROSS:\\nMIKE: So, you\\'re a paleontologist, right?\\nROSS: Yeah.\\nMIKE: My cousin\\'s a paleontologist.\\nROSS: Ah?  Well, he and I would probably have    a lot to talk about.\\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler\\'s apartment. Monica is wearing a sexy negligee.    She pours two glasses of wine as Chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase.    He sets the case by the door.)\\nMONICA: Hi.\\nCHANDLER: Hey.\\nMONICA: Welcome home.\\nCHANDLER:  Oh well, look at you.\\nMONICA: Yeah. What do you think?\\nCHANDLER: Well, it looks great. It\\'s just that . . . well, I\\'m wearing the    same thing underneath. So . . .\\nMONICA: Oh.\\nCHANDLER: See what I mean . . .\\nJOEY: Hey! How come the door\\'s locked?\\nMONICA: Just a second.\\nCHANDLER:  No, no, no, no, no. Joey can\\'t know that I\\'m here.\\nMONICA: Why not?\\nCHANDLER: Because I didn\\'t know how to tell him that I couldn\\'t go to the Knicks    game. So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.\\nMONICA: So, you lied to him?\\nCHANDLER: Achhh. It\\'s always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.     Except with you.\\nJOEY: Hey! Open the door. What\\'s going on?\\nJOEY: What are you . ..  Why are you dressed    like that?\\nMONICA: Oh, because, um . . . well, Chandler\\'s going to be home in a couple    of days. So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.\\nJOEY: Oh, I thought I heard a man\\'s voice before.\\nMONICA: Oh I was just doing Chandler\\'s side of the conversation. You know,    like, \"Hi, How do I look?\"  \"Really sexy. Could I BE any more    turned on?\"\\nJOEY: Okay.     Whoa, whoa. Why are there two glasses of wine out?\\nMONICA: Because. . . one of them is for you.\\nMONICA: Cheers.\\nCHANDLER: You know, it\\'s funny. I\\'ve been, ah, practicing the art of seduction    myself.  Hi ya.\\nMONICA: You might want to keep practicing.\\nCHANDLER: Yah.\\nCHANDLER: It\\'s Joey.  Hey Joe.\\nJOEY: Dude, come home!\\nCHANDLER: What? Why?\\nJOEY: COME . . . HOME.\\nCHANDLER: Look I, I can\\'t. What\\'s going on?\\nJOEY: I don\\'t know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica\\'s cheatin\\'    on ya. I told you shouldn\\'t have married someone so much hotter than you.\\nJOEY: All right look.  If you can\\'t come home and    deal with this, then I\\'m gonna.\\nCHANDLER: NO!\\nJOEY:  I just heard him!\\nCHANDLER:  Can you . . . hear him . . . now?\\nJOEY:  All right, I\\'m going in.\\nCHANDLER: No! Wait!\\nJOEY: I heard him again!\\nCHANDLER:  All right, look. Just stay there. I\\'m    coming home.\\nJOEY: Okay. Great. I\\'ll see you when you get here. I\\'m gonna wait out in    the hall in case the dude comes out.\\nCHANDLER: Is that really necessary?\\nJOEY: Absolutely. You\\'d do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I    know how to keep my women satisfied.\\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel\\'s apartment. Mike is blowing a note from his beer    bottle. Ross stares off to the side.)\\nROSS: Shouldn\\'t the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes    or less. Well, how long has it been?\\nMIKE:  And now twelve.    So, do you like the beer?\\nROSS: I do. I do. Although, it\\'s actually a lager.\\nMIKE: huh.  What\\'s the difference between beer and lager?\\nROSS: I don\\'t know. We could look it up.\\nMIKE:  Things are about to get wild.\\nPHOEBE: Oh God. Remember the girls\\' nights we used to have sitting around    talking about you and Ross?\\nRACHEL: Oh God. It seems like forever ago.\\nPHOEBE: I know.  So, what\\'s going on with you and Ross?\\nRACHEL: Well, um . . . I don\\'t know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But    you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah    . . . little thing.\\nPHOEBE: Oh my God! I love things. What happened?\\nRACHEL: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we    had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.\\nPHOEBE: Eye-contact?\\nRACHEL: Mm-hmm.\\nPHOEBE: I hope you were using protection.\\nWAITER:  Excuse me. Um, these are from the two    gentlemen at the end of the bar.\\nRACHEL: Oh.  Should we send them something back?\\nPHOEBE: Oooh. Let\\'s do. Let\\'s send them mashed potatoes.\\nRACHEL: No! Wait! No, no. Don\\'t do that! That\\'s going to make them think    they can come over here.\\nPHOEBE: So? What if they do?\\nRACHEL: Well, we\\'re not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a    b. . . baby and a Ross.\\nPHOEBE: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We\\'re just having fun.    You know, not everything had to go as far as \"eye-contact.\"\\nMONICA: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you\\'re not in Tulsa.\\nCHANDLER: Don\\'t you think it\\'s better for him to think that you\\'re cheating    on me, than for him to think that I\\'m cheating on him?  I heard it.\\nMONICA: I don\\'t want him to think that I\\'m having an affair.\\nCHANDLER: All right. I\\'ve got a plan. I\\'ll go down the fire escape.\\nMONICA: Yes, because all good plans start with, \"I\\'ll go down the fire escape.\"\\nCHANDLER: Hear me out woman. I\\'ll go down the fire escape. Then, I\\'ll wait    for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it\\'ll be just like I just got    back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there\\'s no guy    in here.\\nMONICA: Aren\\'t you afraid that Joey\\'s going to figure all of this out?     I heard it.\\nCHANDLER: I\\'m just going to wait for a little while.\\nMONICA: Scary pigeon\\'s back?\\nCHANDLER: It\\'s huge.\\nRACHEL: Oh my God. I can\\'t believe you live in that building. My grandmother    lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells    like chicken? Looks like a potato.\\nBILL: \"Spuds\" is your grandmother?\\nRACHEL: That\\'s my bubby!\\nKEVIN: So, we\\'re on our way to a couple of parties. Um. . . maybe we can get    your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.\\nPHOEBE: Yeah. . . I\\'m sorry. We weren\\'t really looking for anything to happen    with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.\\n   KEVIN: All right. It\\'s no big deal.      BILL: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?      RACHEL: Oh, well, it\\'s complicated. I don\\'t actually have a boyfriend. But    um. . .      BILL: Then, can I have your number?      RACHEL:  Wow. So, that\\'s great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma    are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?\\nRACHEL: I don\\'t know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.\\nPHOEBE: What about Ross? What about your moment? Don\\'t you want to talk to    Ross about it?\\nRACHEL: No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation\\'s gonna go. \"Hey    Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before.\"\\nRACHEL:  \"Me too.\"\\nRACHEL:  \"Well, but I\\'m not sure I really want to do anything about    it.\"\\nRACHEL:\\nRACHEL:  \"Well, should we just continue to live together and not    really tell each other how we\\'re really feeling?\"\\nRACHEL:\\nPHOEBE: Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.\\nRACHEL: Oh, thanks.\\nPHOEBE: But, your Rachel wasn\\'t whiny enough.\\nRACHEL:  Wha. . . hey!\\nPHOEBE:  Better!\\nRACHEL: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments    with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.\\nPHOEBE: Really? You\\'re moving on from Ross?\\nRACHEL: I don\\'t know. Do I have to decide right now?\\nPHOEBE: Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight.    Ross is going to pick up the phone and that\\'s a pretty clear message.\\nRACHEL: Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get    my number back.  Oh my God.    He\\'s gone.\\nPHOEBE:  Dead on.\\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel\\'s apartment. Ross and Mike are sitting on the sofa.    Ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while Mike blows his cheeks out.    Ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.)\\nMIKE:  Ya know, I\\'m going to take off.\\nROSS: So soon?\\nMIKE: Well, yeah.\\nROSS: Okay. Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.\\nMIKE: Ah, you mean lager.\\nROSS: Ah yeah. Good times.\\nMIKE:  Oh.\\nMIKE: Hello?\\nPHOEBE:  Hey, Mike, it\\'s me. Listen,    is um, is Ross near you?\\nMIKE: Uh, no. I just left.\\nPHOEBE: Well, you have to go back in.\\nMIKE: Wha . . .? Go back? To the \"land where time stands still\"?\\nPHOEBE: I\\'m so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,    um, she doesn\\'t want Ross to answer the phone. So, you have to intercept all    his calls.\\nMIKE: I can\\'t do that!\\nPHOEBE:  He says he can\\'t do that.\\nRACHEL: Oh give me , , ,  Hi, Mike? Hi.    Listen. I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what? If you do this I .    . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want. Seriously, I\\'m talking dirty stuff.\\nPHOEBE: All right.  Hello? Hi. I\\'m sorry    about her, but she wasn\\'t wrong about the dirty stuff.\\nMIKE: All right. I\\'ll do it.     But really, how much dirtier can it get?\\nPHOEBE:  Oh, Mike. Bye.\\nMIKE: Hey buddy.\\nROSS: Uh, hi.\\nMIKE: Um, can I come back in?\\nROSS:\\nMIKE:  I, I was just thinking about how much more we    have to talk about.\\nROSS:  But you left.\\nJOEY: Wow! That didn\\'t take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three    hour flight.\\nCHANDLER:  Well, you\\'re forgetting about the time difference.\\nMONICA:  Chandler! You\\'re home!\\nCHANDLER: That\\'s right. You\\'re husband\\'s home. So, now the sex can stop.\\nMONICA: What are you saying?\\nCHANDLER: Joey said that you\\'re in here with another man.\\nMONICA: There\\'s no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.\\nJOEY: All right. All right. Then, maybe you won\\'t mind if me and my friend    take a look around, huh?  Bwa-ah-ah!\\nCHANDLER:  What is he doing?\\nMONICA:  I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.\\nJOEY:  Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.\\nCHANDLER: All right. Well, I\\'ll check the guest room.\\nJOEY:  Why do I smell men\\'s cologne?\\nMONICA:  I think that\\'s you.\\nJOEY:  Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.\\nCHANDLER: There\\'s nobody here Joe.\\nJOEY: I guess not.\\nMONICA: I can\\'t believe you thought I was cheating.  You    own me an apology.\\nJOEY: Yeah, right Monica. I\\'m so sorry.\\nMONICA:  Ah, it\\'s an honest mistake. It could    happen to anyone. All right, see ya.\\nJOEY:  Whoa,    whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how    did your suitcase beat you here?\\nCHANDLER:  I climb down the fire escape and you    can\\'t put that in the closet?\\nMIKE: So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the    same thing. Fascinating isn\\'t it.\\nROSS: Maybe you should look up \"fascinating.\"\\nMIKE: I\\'ll get it.  It\\'s for you.\\nROSS:  I don\\'t understand what just happened    here.\\nJOEY: What\\'s going on?\\nCHANDLER: I\\'m sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend    the night with Monica and I, I didn\\'t know . . . I didn\\'t think you\\'d understand.\\nJOEY: What? You think I\\'m too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be    with his wife? Huh? Do you think I\\'m like, \"Duh.\"\\nMONICA: Joey?\\nJOEY: Yeah?\\nMONICA: I don\\'t know what to say. We shouldn\\'t have lied to you.\\nCHANDLER: Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to    you?\\nJOEY:  Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know    you said you couldn\\'t. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a    bump on the head.\\nCHANDLER: I\\'m sorry. That\\'s the one thing I can\\'t do. I promised I\\'d be with    Monica.\\nJOEY: All right.\\nMONICA:  You can go.\\nCHANDLER: What?\\nMONICA: You should go to the game. It\\'s okay. I want you to.\\nCHANDLER: Really? You\\'re gonna be okay?\\nMONICA: Yeah, I\\'ll be fine. You know, maybe I\\'ll stay here and practice the    art of seduction.\\nCHANDLER: You\\'re gonna put on sweats and clean, aren\\'t you?\\nMONICA: It\\'s gonna be so hot!\\nCHANDLER: Okay, bye.\\nMONICA: Have fun.\\nJOEY: Thanks.  Here\\'s your ticket.\\nCHANDLER: Hey, listen. I\\'m never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want    you to know that nobody thinks you\\'re stupid.\\nJOEY: Thanks man.\\nJOEY: Where are you going?\\nCHANDLER: Game\\'s tomorrow night Joe.\\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel\\'s apartment. Rachel and Phoebe enter.)\\nRACHEL: Hi.\\nROSS: Oh God.\\nRACHEL: Oh . . .\\nMIKE: I\\'m so glad you\\'re back.\\nPHOEBE: Oh.\\nRACHEL: Wow. So, what did you guys do?\\nROSS: Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries    of normal social conduct.\\nMIKE: It\\'s true. I did.\\nPHOEBE:  Well, good bye.\\nRACHEL: That was fun Pheebs.\\nPHOEBE: I know. That was fun.\\nRACHEL: See you guys.\\nROSS: Rachel, lock the door. Lock the door, seriously.\\nRACHEL: Oh shoot. I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.  Wait, wait. Sorry. Did he call?    Did that guy call?\\nMIKE: No. Just his mom.\\nRACHEL: Oh, around 8:30?\\nMIKE: Yeah.\\nRACHEL: Then, again at 9:00?\\nMIKE:  uh-huh.\\nRACHEL: Yeah.\\nROSS: Hello.  Okay, \"Bill from the bar.\"    I\\'ll make sure she gets your number.\\nRACHEL: Aaah.\\nROSS: So, ah . . . So, how was it? Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have    a good time?\\nRACHEL: Oh, it was so much fun. It felt so good to be out.\\nROSS:  Uh, Rach.\\nRACHEL:  Yeah?\\nROSS:  Never    mind.\\nROSS: Hey you guys.\\nMIKE: Hey.\\nPHOEBE: Hey. I\\'ll be right back. I\\'ve got to go to the bathroom.\\nMIKE:  Stout. That\\'s a kind of beer.\\n(Ross smiles slightly. Then he gives a single nod that lifts him to his feet.    He exits the coffee shop.\\n======== 09-10\\n Aired: 12/12/2002 Written by: Doty Abrams Directed by: Kevin S.

You really wrote that?\\nPhoebe:  Uh-huh.\\nChandler:  Say goodbye elves, I\\'m off to Tulsa.\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe you\\'re not gonna be here for Christmas.\\nRoss: You\\'re really not coming back?\\nChandler: Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don\\'t get it done, I\\'ll be fired.\\nMonica: It\\'s so unfair, you don\\'t even like your job!\\nChandler: So, who does?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I like my job.\\nJoey: I *love* my job.\\nRachel: Yeah, I can\\'t *wait* to go back to work.\\nRoss: I can\\'t get *enough* dinosaurs!\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry, I won\\'t be here.\\nMonica: It\\'s just... It\\'s hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.\\nChandler: Thanks.  I\\'ll see you New Year\\'s Day.\\nMonica:  You\\'re not gonna be here New Year\\'s Eve??\\nChandler: Did I not mention that?\\nMonica: No!\\nChandler:\\n*Opening Credits*\\nChandler: All right everybody, I know that it\\'s Christmas Eve and you\\'d rather be with your families, but there\\'s *no* call  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.\\nWendy: Hey!\\nOthers: Hey.\\nChandler: Hey. Where\\'ve you been?\\nWendy: I was, uh, checking out that insurance company\\'s Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.\\nChandler:  You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it\\'s gonna smell like ham in here.\\nClaudia: My kid\\'s in a play right now.\\nChandler: Y\\'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told \\'em about all the hard work you\\'ve been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.\\nKen:  \"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet\".\\nChandler: Well, that\\'s like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!\\nWendy: *Now* it feels like Christmas.\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.\\nKen: You can come to my house!\\nChandler: Haha, no thanks!\\nWendy: That was a nice pep-talk.\\nChandler: Oh, thanks! I\\'m... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.\\nWendy: So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?\\nChandler: Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...\\nPhoebe: So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.\\n\"Went to the store, sat on Santa\\'s lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven\\'t heard it yet, so don\\'t try to sing along. No, don\\'t sing along.\\nMonica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!\"\\nHappy holidays, everybody!\\nRachel: Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.\\nChandler: I can save you time ladies, I\\'m right here.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, Chandler why don\\'t you take a walk? This doesn\\'t concern you.\\nRachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.\\nChandler: What? That\\'s terrible!\\nPhoebe: No-no, we do it every year!\\nChandler: Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.\\nPhoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! She\\'s always best at us, that wily... minx.\\nRachel: Don\\'t worry, we\\'re just gonna search here for an hour, and then we\\'re gonna go over to Joey\\'s and search, OK?\\nChandler: No not okay, you can\\'t look for Monica\\'s presents!\\nPhoebe: Oh no, we have to!\\nChandler: No, you don\\'t have to, and you can\\'t because I, I live here too.\\nPhoebe: Well then, you should look with us.\\nChandler: Why?\\nRachel: Chandler, aren\\'t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?\\nChandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.\\nPhoebe: Oh, that\\'s it?  A great idea! Oh yeah.\\nRachel: Chandler, that\\'s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you\\'ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that\\'s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?\\nChandler: If I help, we can find \\'em faster!\\nRachel: That\\'s right!\\nPhoebe: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!\\nRachel: Oh, it\\'s a Macy\\'s bag!\\nRachel: Oh.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, who\\'s it for?\\nRachel:  \"Dear losers, do you really think I\\'d hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they\\'d break you.\"\\nJoey: Rach, these are for you.\\nRachel: Wiper blades. I don\\'t even have a car.\\nJoey: No, but with this new car smell, you\\'ll think you do.\\nChandler: OK, Pheebs, your turn.\\nPhoebe: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?\\nJoey: Uh-huh.\\nPhoebe: You guuuyys.\\nJoey: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.\\nRoss: You got me a cola drink?\\nChandler: And, a lemon lime.\\nRoss: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.\\nChandler: And last but not least.\\nJoey: They\\'re ribbed for *your* pleasure.\\nRoss: Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?\\nBen: Cool!\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nMonica: Come on Ben.\\nRoss: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...\\nChandler:  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\\nBen: Santa!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nRoss: What are you doing here, Santa?\\nChandler: Well, I\\'m here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?\\nRoss: I\\'m the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?\\nChandler: What?\\nMonica: Okay Ben, why don\\'t you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There\\'s a sentence I\\'d never thought I\\'d say.\\nRoss:  What are you doing?\\nChandler: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\\nRoss: Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.\\nChandler: Why?\\nRoss: Because, I\\'m finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you\\'re-you\\'re wrecking it.\\nChandler: But I didn\\'t get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\\nRoss: I\\'m sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.\\nChandler: Fine, I\\'ll give the suit back.\\nMonica:\\nChandler: Santa? Really?\\nMonica: Yeah, is that okay?\\nChandler: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\\nMonica: No.\\nChandler: Then it\\'s okaaay!\\nChandler: You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It\\'s bad enough that we\\'re working New Year\\'s Eve.\\nChandler: Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year\\'s Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.\\nChandler: Good, God\\'s speed, good people!  You\\'re not gonna go?\\nWendy: Naah... I couldn\\'t leave you alone.\\nChandler: Ah. Thanks.\\nWendy: Besides, I can\\'t leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.\\nChandler: Ah.  Chandler Bing.\\nMonica: Hi Honey! We\\'re all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.\\nOthers:\\nPhoebe:  Ble-blah-blar Blargh!\\nChandler: Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!\\nMonica: So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?\\nChandler: Ah, well no, it\\'s just uh, me and Wendy.\\nMonica: Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl\\'s name.\\nChandler: It is. Did I... not tell you about her?\\nMonica: Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year\\'s Eve. Where is everybody else?\\nChandler: I sent them home.\\nMonica: Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?\\nChandler: Uhh, uh...\\nRoss:  Answer faster, answer faster!\\nChandler: I don\\'t know!\\nRoss:  Answer better, answer better!\\nChandler: I don\\'t think of her that way, you know, she\\'s a, she\\'s a colleague.\\nMonica: What does she do there?\\nChandler: Oh, she\\'s regional Vice President; She\\'s... just below me.\\nMonica: She did WHAT?\\nChandler: BE-LOW me!\\nJoey: Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?\\nMonica: *What*??\\nChandler: Well, she... she didn\\'t win...\\nMonica: Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.\\nChandler: Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she\\'s probably...\\nRachel:  Oh Chandler, stop talking!\\nChandler: Honey, there\\'s really nothing to worry about.\\nMonica: Okay.\\nChandler: I\\'m serious!\\nMonica: Okay!\\nChandler: Merry Christmas.\\nMonica: Merry Christmas.\\nChandler: Merry Christmas, you guys!\\nOthers:\\nPhoebe:  Blah blargah, blar-blab.\\nChandler:  The wife says \"Hi!\".\\nWendy: Ah. Fun conversation?\\nChandler: Ah well, she\\'s got this weird idea, that, uh, y\\'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.\\nWendy: Huh? Really? -- Hm, that\\'d be so terrible?\\nChandler: This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you\\'re getting ham on my only tie.\\nChandler: Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!\\nWendy:  ...Missy?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know; I\\'m not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?\\nWendy: You are to me...\\nChandler:  Look, I\\'m, I\\'m married!\\nWendy: So? I\\'m married.\\nChandler: I\\'m *happily* married.\\nWendy: Oh. - What\\'s *that* like?\\nChandler: Right. So, I\\'m sorry...\\nWendy: Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?\\nChandler: Well look, it\\'s not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She\\'s entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she\\'s amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she\\'d kick your ass. Look, you\\'re a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.\\nWendy: Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?\\nChandler: I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!\\nMonica: Really?\\nChandler: You kidding? You\\'re the most beautiful woman in most rooms...  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What\\'s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\\nMonica: Well, not anymore.\\nChandler: But we don\\'t do that.\\nMonica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.\\nChandler: How drunk are you?\\nMonica: Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.\\nChandler:  That\\'s the perfect amount!\\nMonica: Okay!\\nMonica:  Y\\'know what\\'s weird?\\nChandler: What?\\nMonica: This doesn\\'t feel weird!\\nChandler: I know.\\nMonica: You\\'re a really good kisser.\\nChandler: Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?\\nMonica: Hm-hmm!\\nChandler: Okay!\\nMonica: Wow! You are really fast!\\nChandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\\nMonica: We\\'re gonna see each other naked.\\nChandler: Yep!\\nMonica: Do you wanna do it at the same time?\\nChandler: Count of three?\\nMonica: One!\\nChandler: Two!\\nMonica: Two!\\nBoth: Three!\\nChandler: Well I think it\\'s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.\\nMonica: Eh, we weren\\'t that close anyway!\\nChandler: Eh!\\nChandler: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?\\nMonica: Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.\\nChandler: Y\\'know, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y\\'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.\\nMonica: I think you\\'re better than you think you are.\\nChandler: Really? Okay, so...\\nMonica:  Know when to stop.\\nChandler: Y\\'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we\\'re okay?\\nMonica: Yeah.  Don\\'t do the dance.\\nChandler: Right!\\nMonica: I can\\'t get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\\nChandler: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here\\'s something, here\\'s something blue and new.\\nMonica: You\\'re so efficient. I love you!\\nChandler: Let\\'s go!\\nMonica: No-no-no, wait! We need something old!\\nChandler: Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I\\'ve had since I was twelve.\\nMonica: That\\'ll work!\\nChandler: I don\\'t think so.\\nMonica: Okay, now we just need something borrowed!\\nChandler:\\nMonica: That\\'s stealing!\\nChandler: No, we\\'ll-we\\'ll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.\\nMonica: Ohh.\\nChandler: Okay, one thing at a time.\\nMonica: Listen umm, I\\'ve been thinking, it\\'s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.\\nChandler: Ehh.\\nMonica: Eh, you work for that.\\nChandler: Look, I thought about it too, and I\\'m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.\\nMonica: You do?!\\nChandler: Yeah, I\\'m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that\\'s what we\\'re gonna do.\\nMonica: Oh, you\\'re so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?\\nChandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y\\'know? We\\'ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\\nMonica: You thought about that?\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nMonica: How many kids were we gonna have?\\nChandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\\nMonica: What else did you think about?\\nChandler: Well, stuff like where we\\'d live, y\\'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y\\'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we\\'d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.\\nMonica:  Y\\'know what? I-I don\\'t want a big, fancy wedding.\\nChandler: Sure you do.\\nMonica: No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.\\nChandler: You sure?\\nMonica: Uh-hmm.\\nChandler: I love you so much.\\nMonica: I love you.\\nRachel:  Oohh, I love it!\\nRoss: Really? You\\'re not gonna return it?\\nRachel: Well, not this second!\\nPhoebe:  Hey look, you guys, it\\'s snowing!\\nRachel: Oh wow, it\\'s so beautiful...\\nRoss: Wow, it really is!\\nMonica: \"Wendy\" is a fat girl name.\\nPhoebe: Aren\\'t we done with that?\\nMonica: Okay, fine. Let\\'s talk about snow. -- Do you think it\\'s snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?\\nChandler: Hey!\\nRoss: Oh my god...\\nJoey: Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it\\'s a Christmas miracle!\\nMonica: What are you doing here?\\nChandler: I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.\\nJoey: Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?\\nChandler: Monica.\\nJoey: Got ya.\\nChandler: I never want to leave you again!\\nMonica: But I thought if you left, you get fired.\\nChandler: Turns out they can\\'t fire me. Because I quit.\\nMonica: What?\\nRoss: What, you, you really quit your job?\\nChandler: Yeah! It\\'s a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn\\'t get to do what he *really* wants to do?\\nRachel: What do you really want to do?\\nChandler:  I have *not* thought this through!\\nMonica: Oh my god!\\nChandler: I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.\\nMonica: No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it\\'s great!\\nChandler: Thanks!\\nPhoebe: Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.\\nChandler:  Ahh...\\nPhoebe: Now give me my real gift.\\nPhoebe:  Thank you.\\nChandler:\\nRoss: Oh, hey...\\nRoss:  \"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet.\" -- How did you know?\\nRachel: Wha... are you kidding? I can\\'t return this.\\nChandler: I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.\\nJoey: Mine\\'s is to Lilian Myers.\\nChandler: I don\\'t have a *job*!\\n*Closing Credits*\\nChandler: Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no.

And    I-I think you\\'re a really good guy and I\\'m sorry that I misjudged you.\\nHeather: Good morning!\\nRachel: Hello.  I\\'m sorry,    obviously Heather\\'s ass has something more important to say so I\\'ll just wait    \\'till it\\'s finished.\\nGavin: What?\\nRachel: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!\\nGavin: I wasn\\'t checking her out. I\\'m in fashion, I was looking at her    skirt. Or was it pants? I didn\\'t really see what happened below the ass area.\\nRachel: Oh wow, you are really, you\\'re really a creep.\\nGavin: Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?\\nRachel: Oh yeah, I\\'m jealous. \"Oh Gavin, please, please look at    my ass\".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just    think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she\\'s your    subordinate.\\nGavin: I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.\\nRachel: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn\\'t know    that you knew that. And two, I wasn\\'t some creep staring at his ass, we had    a deap meaningful relationship.\\nGavin: Huh. What\\'s Tag\\'s last name?\\nRachel: It was ...  oh my god. He didn\\'t have a last    name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.\\nGavin: But it was a deap meaningful relationship.\\nRachel: Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely    right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag\\'s last name    was Morgan! Huh!\\nGavin: It was Jones.\\nRachel: Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?\\nJoey: Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.\\nMolly: You mean, when you were a baby.\\nJoey: Sure.\\nMonica: Would you stop staring at her?\\nChandler: I wasn\\'t staring. I was leering.\\nMonica: What\\'s the big deal with her? Maybe she\\'s attractive in an obvious kind    of way.\\nRoss: Yeah, obvious beauty\\'s the worst. You know, when it\\'s right there    in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me    feel like I earned it.\\nChandler: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.\\nMonica: Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl    for once.\\nMolly:  I\\'m gonna take her back to the appartment.\\nRoss: Ok, I\\'ll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you    - wovyou dovyou ...\\nMolly: Bye\\nMonica: They\\'ve elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it\\'s not so good.\\nMolly: I think it\\'s sweet.\\nRoss, Joey and Chandler: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.\\nRachel:  Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if    you didn\\'t go after her.\\nJoey: Why not?\\nRachel: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn\\'t want anything    to, you know, drive her away.\\nJoey: So, what, you think I\\'m just gonna sleep with her and never call    her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds    about right.\\nRoss: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just    forget about her, ok? Just, she\\'s off limits.\\nJoey: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told    me I can\\'t have it makes me want her even more!\\nRoss: What are you, a child?\\nJoey: Yes!\\nRoss: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy    on someone else.\\nJoey: Fine.\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe: Hey Mikey\\nMike: Hey P\\nPhoebe: What are you doing?\\nMike: Setting rat traps.\\nPhoebe: To kill Bob??\\nMike: No, no, to test his neck strength.\\nPhoebe: No, Mike, I don\\'t want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.\\nMike: Ok, ok, I\\'ll throw away the traps.\\nPhoebe: I\\'ll find Bob, I\\'ll get him. Bob?  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies!    Bob\\'s a mom!\\nMike: Better think of a new name for him.\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.\\nMike: I don\\'t know, I mean I\\'m not sure  ...\\nPhoebe: Oh my god, we killed Bob!\\nMike: Maybe it wasn\\'t Bob, maybe it was a mouse.\\nPhoebe: Suzie?\\nRoss: Whazzup??\\nChandler: Seriously dude, 3 years ago.\\nRoss: Listen, can you do me a favor? I\\'m gonna be out today. Can you just keep    an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?\\nChandler: You don\\'t trust him?\\nRoss: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked    for her daughter, the \"hot nanny\".\\nChandler: Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?    Because I could get a job any day now.\\nRoss: You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I\\'m    sure he\\'ll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do    this for me?\\nChandler: Allright, fine, but don\\'t blame me if it doesn\\'t work. Because you know    as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,    he\\'s going to have sex with it.\\nRoss: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don\\'t grow on trees.\\nChandler: Picturing that tree?\\nRoss: I am, yes.\\nChandler: Where you going, Joe?\\nJoey: For a walk.\\nChandler: Oh. You mind if I join you?\\nJoey: Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.\\nChandler: Your thoughts? Plural?\\nJoey: Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It\\'s about the hot nanny, I gotta    see her!\\nChandler: I\\'m afraid I can\\'t let you do that, Joe.\\nJoey: Now YOU\\'RE telling me I can\\'t see her?? You guys are killing me!    She\\'s forbidden fruit! It\\'s like ... like she\\'s the princess and I\\'m the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?\\nChandler: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can\\'t let you go.\\nJoey: Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the    world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.\\nChandler: Great novels?\\nJoey: Fine ... mediocre porn\\nGavin: Gavin Mitchelle\\'s office.\\nRachel: Rachel Green\\'s office!! Give me that phone!\\nGavin: Hey Mom! No, that\\'s just my secretary.\\nRachel: Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.\\nGavin: Mom, I\\'ll call you later. Yeah.  Yes?\\nRachel: If you like looking at butts so much why don\\'t you just go look at a mirror?\\nGavin: Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your    pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you,    don\\'t I?\\nRachel: Oh, please, I don\\'t care about you enough to bug me. In fact,    from now on, I\\'m going take the high road. And I\\'m going be very very nice to    you, you \"momma\\'s boy\", starting right now.\\nMonica: Hey Rach!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nMonica: Ready for your birthday lunch?\\nRachel: Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce    you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin    Mitchelle.\\nGavin: Pleased to meet you.\\nMonica: Pleased to meet you. So you\\'re coming to Rachel\\'s party tonight?\\nRachel: Oh no no no no no, Gavin can\\'t, he already has plans, most likely with his    mother.\\nGavin: Well I don\\'t mind, I\\'ll cancel. I would never miss my secretary\\'s birthday.\\nRachel: Why did you invite him?? I can\\'t stand that guy!\\nMonica: You were just being so nice to him!\\nRachel: I was faking it! Can\\'t you tell when I\\'m being fake?\\nRachel: Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!\\nMonica: Right there! That was so fake!\\nRachel: Shh!\\nRachel:  I still can\\'t believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the    last person I want to see.\\nMonica: Oh, you\\'re welcome for the party. I\\'m glad you\\'re having a good time.\\nRachel: God, I hope he doesn\\'t show up. Of course he\\'s not gonna show up, the guy    hates me.\\nMonica: Does he?\\nRachel: What?\\nMonica: Maybe he\\'s bothering you so much because he likes you. It\\'s like in first    grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly    had a crush on me?\\nRachel: Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet    to see if he can knock you over.\\nMolly:  She\\'s out, I\\'m gonna take her home.\\nRachel: Oh, ok, thank you.  Do you see what all the guys    see in her?\\nMonica: Wouldn\\'t kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!\\nJoey: Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?\\nRachel: Yeah, sure!\\nJoey: Oh ...\\nMonica: Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!\\nRachel: Oh, give me!\\nPhoebe: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!\\nMike: Yeah. We have rat babies now.\\nRachel: Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?\\nMonica: So this is what a stroke feels like.\\nPhoebe: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they\\'re our responsibility    now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you\\'re    a mother.\\nRachel: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?\\nPhoebe: No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed    them.\\nRachel: whhh wait, you\\'re gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?\\nPhoebe: Well I\\'m sorry Rachel, but I\\'m not like you, ok? Not everyone    can afford help.\\nRoss: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.\\nChandler:  I\\'m sorry, I got a little occupied.\\nRoss: We have to stop them before something happens!\\nChandler:\\nJoey: So you see, Molly, what people don\\'t understand is that acting is a discipline.    It takes a lot of hard work.\\nMolly: So where did you study?\\nJoey: Oh, I didn\\'t go to college.\\nMolly: No, where did you study acting?\\nJoey: Molly ... people don\\'t study acting ...\\nRoss: Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?\\nMolly: Sure, I\\'ll go check on Emma.\\nRoss: Thanx.\\nJoey:  Will the stable boy never get the princess??\\nRoss: What do you think you\\'re gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?\\nJoey: No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn\\'t fair.    What makes you think that I\\'m just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?    Huh? Can\\'t you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven\\'t felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn\\'t think I could ever love again.\\nRoss and Chandler: Come on! Joe!\\nJoey: Ok\\nWoman: Hi, is Molly here?\\nRoss: Yeah, come on in. Molly?\\nMolly:  I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\\nRoss: Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have    no problem.\\nJoey: It\\'s like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The    princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!\\nPhoebe: Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing    the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.\\nMike: Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve    around their rats?\\nPhoebe: Well, you know what, they\\'re our responsibility now.\\nMike: Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate    and there are hundreds of them?\\nPhoebe: Mate? They\\'re all brothers and sisters.\\nMike: Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they\\'re more of a \"love    the one you\\'re with\" kind of animals.\\nPhoebe: No.     That\\'s math I can\\'t even do! What are we gonna do?\\nMike: Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let    the box of rats ruin our lives.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, ok. I guess you\\'re right. Allright, so we should just give them away.    But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They\\'re Bob\\'s    favorites.\\nMike: It\\'s gonna be ok.\\nPhoebe: You must think I\\'m crazy.\\nMike: No, I think you\\'re sweet.\\nPhoebe: Good. It\\'s just so hard, it\\'s hard for me to ... let them go.    I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to    my brother\\'s triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven\\'t    told you about that yet, have I?\\nMonica: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?\\nMonica: No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?\\nRachel: Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday\\'s over.\\nMonica: Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from    your office didn\\'t show up .\\nRachel: Mmm hmm.\\nGavin: Yeah, hey.\\nMonica: Oh, we weren\\'t talking about you. No, no way to recover.\\nRachel: No.\\nGavin: Nice party.\\nRachel: Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn\\'t showed up at  ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...\\nMonica:  Again, you\\'re welcome.\\nGavin: Look, I\\'ll just give you this and go.\\nRachel: Oh, you bought me a present! Why?\\nGavin: Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There    are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you    the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.\\nRachel: Aww. Well, ok, well that\\'s very nice. And you wrote a card . \"From Gavin\"\\nGavin: I really mean it.\\nRachel:  Awww, awww, it\\'s beautiful.\\nGavin: You don\\'t mind?  Well, what do you know, it fits!\\nRachel: See, Gavin, you\\'re capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such    a hard time?\\nGavin: I\\'m not sure.\\nRachel: Well Monica seems to think it\\'s because you have feelings for me.\\nGavin: I do have feelings for you.\\nRachel: You do?\\nGavin: Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.\\nRachel: See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I\\'m about to change my opinion    of you, you go and you ...\\nENDING CREDITS\\nChandler:\\nPhoebe:  Hey\\nChandler:  Hi\\nPhoebe: Listen, I think I\\'ve left something here.\\nChandler: Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?\\nPhoebe:  No, but I like it. I think I left one of    my rat babies.\\nChandler: Oh, uh, well, I haven\\'t seem it but if I do I\\'ll let you know.\\nMonica: Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!\\nPhoebe:  Ooh, maybe that\\'s him!\\n======== 09-13\\n913 - The One Where Monica Sings\\nAired: 30/01/2003\\nWritten by: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Plummer\\nTeleplay by: Steven Rosenhaus\\nTranscribed by: PHDB\\nChandler: Hey!\\nRoss: Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what  happened here last night?\\nChandler: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like  you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what  they did or didn\\'t do ...I mean come on!!\\nRoss: OK you...you really don\\'t know what I am talking about?\\nChandler: No!\\nRoss: OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from  her office out on your balcony.\\nChandler: Our balcony? Seriously? That\\'s so funny because I told Monica  we should put lights on our balcony. And she said\"No, no. It\\'s too cold,  nobody will go out there.\" And I said \"Maybe if we put some light out there they  will\"\\nRoss: Right that\\'s why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel  kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !\\nChandler: So are you gonna...talk to her?\\nRoss: Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that\\'s  fine!\\nChandler: You know when \"That\\'s fine\" sounds true when someone yells it  and spits!\\nRoss: No I\\'m serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don\\'t care  but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I\\'ve been putting my life  on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing  guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah!  Ah!\\nChandler: No no no. Good. So you\\'re moving on? Do you have any idea where  you\\'re moving?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now  there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other  day on the subway a woman \"accidentally\" sat on my hand.\\nChandler: Dude, don\\'t rub my face in your crazy single life!\\nRoss: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who  totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.\\nChandler: Why did I get married?!\\nJoey: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken  tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows  waxed. Is that weird for a guy?\\nPhoebe: Well it depends.\\nJoey: On...?\\nPhoebe: On how far along he\\'s in the sex change process!\\nMonica: No I totally disagree. No I think it\\'s fine for a guy to do  something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows  are...\\nJoey: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You\\'re freaking me out!\\nPhoebe: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...\\nJoey: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!\\nPhoebe: Wow! Talking about high maintenance\\nJoey: Hey hey! You dye your hair!\\nPhoebe: I\\'m a woman!\\nJoey: Arghhh! Double standards!\\nPhoebe: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike\\'s piano bar  tonight?\\nMonica: Only if I don\\'t have to get up and sing.\\nPhoebe: But everybody sings. It\\'s so much fun! Last time this adorable  old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone  booed him off the stage. So funny.\\nMonica: It\\'s just, I\\'m not good at singing.\\nPhoebe: Oh! What\\'s the matter? Are you scared? You\\'re afraid I\\'m a better  singer? You\\'re afraid I\\'m gonna beat you at singing?\\nMonica: No no, it\\'s not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!\\nPhoebe: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don\\'t have to  sing.\\nMonica: So I don\\'t have to sing and I can just sit there and pass  judgments on others?\\nPhoebe: While drinking...\\nMonica: I\\'m there!\\nRachel: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something  really stupid.\\nPhoebe: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out  there\\nRachel: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.\\nPhoebe: Oh my god.\\nMonica: You kissed him?\\nRachel: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony  and...\\nMonica: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed  that?\\nPhoebe: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping  paper.\\nMonica: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?\\nRachel: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me  and, oh and he gave me this scarf...\\nMonica: I thought you hated him?\\nRachel: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and  it turns out that line...is a scarf!\\nMonica: So are you thinking of starting up something with this  guy?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know. It\\'s so complicated. I work with this guy, you  know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don\\'tknow what to do  and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.\\nMonica: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin,  and you definitely should talk to Ross\\nRachel: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...\\nPhoebe: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you\\'re back for four days, kiss  a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!\\nSalon girl: Hi\\nJoey: Hey. I\\'m here for my eyebrow appointment.\\nSalon girl: Name?\\nJoey: Chandler Bing.\\nSalon girl: Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia  will be right with you.\\nJoey: OK Thanks.. I touched the  stuff\\nSonia: I\\'ll take care of it\\nJoey: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?\\nSonia: Oh absolutely.\\nJoey: Oh good...\\nSonia: Are you looking to meet somebody?\\nJoey: All right let\\'s just do this.\\nSonia: We\\'ll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of  the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...\\nJoey: Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My  face! My face!! I\\'m all right! I\\'m all right!Just a little bit of shock  that\\'s all but I\\'ll be fine you can go again. I\\'m OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!\\nChandler: Hey it\\'s the most eligible man in NY. How\\'s the moving on  going?\\nRoss: Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand  but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.\\nChandler: Well maybe you\\'re going about this the wrong way. You know I  mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two  illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....\\nRoss: That\\'s funny...Do you think you\\'ll ever work again?\\nChandler: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe Rachel just moved on and didn\\'t say anything to  me\\nChandler: Maybe she didn\\'t move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just  an impulsive one-time birthday thing\\nRoss: No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a  bar.\\nChandler: Did she go out with him?\\nRoss: No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.\\nChandler: Ah! The high road...\\nRoss: You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey  check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!\\nChandler: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?\\nRoss: You don\\'t have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the  two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of  jokes so that they know you\\'re the funny one and I swoop in with some  interesting conversation, sothey\\'ll see that I\\'m the brilliant, brooding,  sexy one...\\nChandler: I thought I had to make the jokes!\\nRoss: Don\\'t you have to be at work?\\nChandler: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here\\'s my friend  Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you\\'re up for it. We only  need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!\\nRoss: Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the  paper...another flood in Europe? Heres a question: \"Would you...would you  rather drown or be burnt alive?\"\\nBlonde girl: Sorry...we were just leaving\\nChandler: We still got it!\\nRachel: Who is it?\\nGavin: Gavin! I brought you some soup.\\nRachel: Why?\\nGavin: I heard you were sick...\\nRachel: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I\\'ll be just clean up in here a little  bit! Hello Gavin\\nGavin: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?\\nRachel: I a not gonna lie to you, I\\'m pretty sick\\nGavin: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I  thought you called in sick to avoid me.\\nRachel: Oh no no no\\nGavin: So I had fun last night\\nRachel: So did I\\nGavin: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold  for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?\\nRachel: It\\'s just a cold\\nGavin: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...\\nRachel: What? What\\'s the matter?\\nGavin: What\\'s Ross doing to you on that picture?\\nRachel: Oh he\\'s dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be  funny.\\nGavin: Right. Right. Ross. So what\\'s the deal with you guys? I don\\'t want  to get in the middle of anything\\nRachel: Oh you\\'re not. You\\'re not gonna get in the middle of anything,  don\\'t worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That\\'s Ross! Hide! Hide!\\nGavin: Yeah! But you said not to worry about...\\nRachel: I lied! And I\\'m not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!\\nMolly: Hi!\\nRachel: Oh! Molly! You\\'re not Ross.\\nMolly: No I\\'m here to take Emma to your mother\\'s, remember?\\nRachel: Right, right, yes!\\nMolly: Don\\'t panic!\\nRachel: What?\\nMolly: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my  purse.\\nRachel: No! That\\'s OK! That\\'s OK! That\\'s OK! No no no no! This is my  business associate Gavin. He\\'s just being silly.Gavin come out from behind  that curtain!\\nGavin: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand  there.\\nMolly: Hello! I just go and get Emma.\\nRachel: OK.\\nGavin: So hum...Why did I have to hide?\\nRachel: I thought it was Ross.\\nGavin: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between  you two...\\nRachel: There isn\\'t. There is totally isn\\'t.\\nGavin: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming  out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.\\nRachel: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were  here, which I shouldn\\'t. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship  but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus  there is just so muchhistory...you know it\\'s just...I don\\'t know, I\\'m sorry,  I\\'m just all over the place.\\nGavin: It\\'s OK. I know it\\'s probably not my place but can I give you a  piece of advice?\\nRachel: Yes\\nGavin: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.\\nRachel: People keep saying that. Oh I\\'m sorry Gavin\\nGavin: Don\\'t be. It\\'s just bad timing.\\nRachel: So seriously...rodeo clown?\\nGavin: One of the best, ma\\'am, one of the best...\\nPhoebe: \"No time for losers, \\'cause we are the champions of the  world...!\" Thank you!\\nMike: Oh she\\'s my girlfriend. That\\'s not just how we do it here. I got to  get a break and when we come back we\\'ve got Kennethsinging \"I touch  myself\"...I\\'m not here to judge!\\nPhoebe: Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.\\nMonica: No I told you I can\\'t.\\nPhoebe: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice  voice.\\nMonica: What have you heard me sing?\\nPhoebe: All the time when you\\'re cooking.\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: Yeah you\\'re always singing \"Yummy yummy yummy, I\\'ve got love in  my tummy\"\\nMonica: Yeah I do rock that one.\\nPhoebe: OK so isn\\'t there a little part of you that wants to get up  there?\\nMonica: Just a little but...it\\'s just so scary! I don\\'t even know what I  would sing...\\nMike: Well I\\'ve got a book around...\\nMonica: \"Delta Dawn\"\\nRoss: Hi! I could help not notice, but that\\'s an unusual necklace\\nWoman: You already hit on me an hour ago\\nRoss: Right, so that\\'s a firm \"no\". I cannot believe this, I just keep  striking out.\\nChandler: I don\\'t get it neither, I mean you\\'re obviously desperate,  you\\'re asking women how they want to be killed\\nRoss: This is great. Rachel\\'s gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the  one she wants and I\\'m gonna die alone.\\nChandler: By drowning or...?!\\nMichelle: Why would he break up with me?\\nHer friend: I don\\'t know sweetie.\\nMichelle: All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back.  I mean, am I so unlovable?\\nChandler: Well...\\nRoss: I know!\\nMike: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of  \"I touch myself\". Coming up next we\\'ve got Monicasinging \"Delta  Dawn\".\\nMonica: Wait wait! I can\\'t sing in front of all these people.\\nPhoebe: Just pretend they\\'re not even here! It\\'s OK Monica, when that  spotlight hits you it so bright you won\\'t see anyoneanyway.\\nMonica: Hi! I\\'m Monica and I\\'m gonna be singing \"Delta Dawn\"\"Delta  Dawn, what\\'s that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone  by? ...\"\\nPhoebe: Can you totally see through her shirt ?\\nMike: Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.\\nMonica: \"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?\"\\nJoey: Hey, I need your help.\\nChandler: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley  Judd?\\nJoey: Look, I\\'ll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my  eyebrows shaped\\nChandler: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!\\nJoey: You may be a sissy but I\\'ll still . All  right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they  dont match!\\nChandler: Its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!\\nJoey: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic  marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI dont look stupid for my  pictures.\\nChandler: Ok. First of all, this is green!\\nJoey: What the hell am I supposed to do!\\nChandler: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you  will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.\\nJoey: What, what.\\nChandler: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the  lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows  of my father and his business partners.\\nJoey: Oh my God!\\nChandler: Yeah, well, I guess you dont need my help Victor  Victoria!\\nJoey: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help,  but Chandler I dont know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so  bad!\\nChandler: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my  gentle self-loathing touch.\\nMonica: \"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y\". I am sorry, the song is  over. Did you see me out there?\\nPhoebe: Every little bit of you!\\nMonica: I cant believe I did this. I cant believe I\\'m singing for the  people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting look at those  tips! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?\\nMike: Sure.\\nPhoebe: Mon\\', not that you didnt sound good, but...\\nMonica: Good? Didnt you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for  making me do this. Thats is the best gift ever.\\nMike: Also a good gift? Underwear.\\nMichelle: Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms  freak me out, I can\\'t even pee, let alone doanything else.\\nRoss: But, whats great is that you dont mind talking about it.\\nMichelle: Its so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with  me, because its like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.\\nRoss: Uh-ah!\\nMichelle: No dont worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally  over Eric.\\nRoss: . Good choice Ross.\\nRachel: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, Ive been looking for you  everywhere!\\nRoss: Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.\\nRachel: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock.  So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk somebody  here?\\nRoss: Oh, yeah, yeah thats Michelle.\\nRachel: Who?\\nRoss: Oh, just this woman Ive been seeing.\\nRachel: Youve being seeing someone?\\nRoss: Yeah, didnt I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we havent being going  out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I  mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it  wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.\\nMichelle: What are you taking amoxicillin for?\\nRoss: How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look  through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, thatsmy roommate, Rachel.\\nRachel: Hi, and I am also Emmas mother.\\nMichelle: Ah, who is Emma?\\nRoss: I told you about my daughter.\\nMichelle: This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!\\nChandler: And done!\\nJoey: Oh my God! I didnt feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a  job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the  saloon\\nChandler: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?\\nJoey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look  great! How you doing!\\nChandler: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little  worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to  be a little piece of chocolate.\\nJoey: Thank you so much.\\nChandler: No problem.\\nJoey: Listen thats a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some  manly make up for it.\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nJoey: Comb my eyelashes.\\nMonica: Ok, for my next song I think Ill sing something a little more  upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters I am so excited. And  make it bouncy!\\nPhoebe: Oh youll probably take care of that on your hands.\\nChandler: I am sorry I am late. Youll understand when youll see  Joey.\\nMonica: Honey, youre just in time, Im about to sing another  song!\\nChandler: Really? In front of all this people?\\nMonica: And they love me!\\nChandler: Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Yes, she gives the people what they want.\\nMonica: All right, watch!\\nMonica: \"Tonight\\'s the night we\\'re gonna make it happen, tonight we\\'ll  put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some  affection...\"\\nChandler: Are those my wifes nipples?\\nPhoebe: Oh? Isnt that funny? I didn\\'t see that before, I wouldn\\'t have  let her go up again.\\nChandler: I gotta stop this.\\nMonica: Oh, who cares, they still love me! \"I am so excited...\"\\nChandler: You, touching yourself, out!\\nRachel: Wow. She does that a lot!\\nMichelle: Ross, you didnt tell me you were a doctor!\\nRachel: What, what, wait a minute! You havent even told her you were a  doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?\\nMichelle: Actually about an hour and a half.\\nRoss: I told you it wasnt long, but there is an amazing connection  between us.\\nMichelle: You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!\\nRoss: Are you kidding?\\nMichelle: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?\\nRoss: Well see.\\nRachel: Ok, Ross, whats going on here, are we just bringing strange  women back to the apartment now?\\nRoss: I dont know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?\\nRachel: How do you know about that?\\nRoss: Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to  sleep...\\nMichelle: Emma.\\nRoss: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a  guy you know, for what? A week?\\nRachel: Oh, thats what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to  get back at me?\\nMichelle: No, actually, see I had to pee, cause I cant use public  bathrooms because the doodie parasites.\\nRoss: Ok, Michelle, its time to go.\\nMichelle: Well, call me!\\nRoss: Ok.\\nMichelle: No, wait, you dont have my phone number!\\nRoss: You know, if its meant to be, Ill guess it. Bye, bye.\\nRachel: Score.\\nRoss: Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we  could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.\\nRachel: Oh God, I cant believe youre making such a big deal about this.  It was one kiss, one guy, one time!\\nRoss: Oh, really!\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nRoss: Oh, really!\\nRachel: Oh yeah.\\nRoss: What about the guy from the bar?\\nRachel: What? Who?\\nRoss: The guy you gave your number to.\\nRachel: Whoa, how do you know about that?\\nRoss: Because he called here looking for you. So dont tell me  this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? Youve been  out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didnt even  have the courtesy to tell me.\\nRachel: Why didnt I get that message?\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: From the guy in the bar, why didnt I get that message?\\nRoss: Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you  not look there?\\nRachel: Ross?\\nRoss: I never gave it to you.\\nRachel: Why?\\nRoss: I dont know.\\nRachel: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to  decide what messages I should or should not get?\\nRoss: Who am I?\\nRachel: Yes.\\nRoss: I am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars  meeting guys!\\nRachel: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in  here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I cant do  that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my  apartment!\\nRoss: None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! Thats not the  point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didnt tell  anyone!\\nRachel: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! Whats wrong with us? You  know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, what, you live  together but youre not a couple? And you have a baby, isnt that weird? And I  say No.You know what, its not, because it works for us! But you know this  doesnt work. In fact this is the opposite of working!\\nRoss: Uh, clearly.\\nRachel: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as  long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesnt make sense  anymore.\\nRoss: Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?\\nJoey: Ha, oh, of course.\\nRachel: Thank you.\\nJoey: Your eyebrows look weird.\\nChandler: Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never  understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine. So you  just touch yourself for anything?\\nEND\\n======== 09-14\\nWritten by Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Plummer\\nTranscribed by Marita Bakken\\nJoey: Morning, roomie!\\nRachel: Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.\\nJoey: Fifth day\\'s a charm.\\nRachel: Oh, Joey, it\\'s so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you\\'re       making it so easy on me and Emma.\\nJoey: Hey, it\\'s great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,       and when does she stop crying all night?\\nRoss: Hey, you\\'re not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you       tonight?\\nRachel: Well, I\\'ll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she\\'s       in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,       so...\\nJoey: She\\'s probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did       last night.\\nRachel: Bye!\\nRoss: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn\\'t making it too hard on you.\\nJoey: No, hey, it\\'s been great.\\nRoss: Yeah?\\nJoey: Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying       here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?       And even if they weren\\'t, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using       a breast pump...\\nRoss: Yeah, that\\'ll do it.\\nJoey: Wow! So, how are you?\\nRoss: I\\'m, I\\'m okay.\\nJoey: Really?\\nRoss: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have       worked out? Of course. You know, I\\'m disappointed, but it\\'s not like it\\'s       a divorce.\\nJoey: Well, actually it...\\nRoss: No, it\\'s not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel       and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing       other people.\\nJoey: Wow, really?\\nRoss: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good       for me...\\nJoey: Sure, I know lots of girls.\\nRoss: Yeah? Any names come to mind?\\nJoey: Ooh, names?\\nOpening credits.\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nJoey: Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?\\nPhoebe: What you got?\\nJoey : Okay, let\\'s see, we got strained peas,       strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven\\'t tried that yet.\\nPhoebe: Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart       from the great food.\\nJoey: I\\'m fine, I\\'m fine, it\\'s just, it\\'s just weird what\\'s happening with       her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.\\nPhoebe: Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.\\nJoey: Why are they doing this?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know. They\\'re so perfect for each other; it\\'s crazy.\\nJoey: You know what\\'s crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in       here?\\nPhoebe: I just wish they\\'d realise they should be together.\\nJoey: I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y\\'know,       that\\'s where things were headed.\\nPhoebe: I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have       more children.\\nJoey: Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have       kids; someone\\'s gotta carry on the family name.\\nPhoebe: You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what\\'s       out there, they\\'ll realise how good they are for each other.\\nJoey: Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!       But we should probably keep it down; she\\'s still in the bedroom.\\nPhoebe: So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them       up with people?\\nJoey: I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.\\nPhoebe: Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel       up on horrible dates, so that they\\'ll realise how good they are together.\\nJoey: Ooh, that\\'s a great plan!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my \"plan-laugh.\"\\nJoey: Shhh! Not so loud, we don\\'t wanna wake up, uh...\\nRachel: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nRachel: You guys aren\\'t doing anything tonight, are you?\\nChandler: See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we\\'re married?       I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you\\'ll       excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.\\nRachel: I was just asking \\'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.\\nMonica: Sure, we\\'ll do that. What are you up to?\\nRachel: Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.\\nMonica: Oh my god.\\nChandler: Wow.\\nRachel: Why? What\\'s the big deal?\\nMonica: Just figured, \\'cause you and Ross are...\\nRachel: What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I\\'m all set.\\nChandler: Well, I think it\\'s great that you\\'re going on a date, you know? I       mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!\\nMonica: You want a job? Turn off \"Oprah,\" and send out a resume!\\nRachel: So I\\'ll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?\\nMonica: Oh, it\\'s perfect.\\nRachel: Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She\\'s at such a cute age.       Oh, a couple things. Now that she\\'s eating solid food, she poops around       the clock. And watch out for your hair, \\'cause she likes to grab it. And       oh, she\\'s also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody       murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!\\nChandler : Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, Joey.\\nJoey: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Hey. I\\'m so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.\\nJoey: All right! Who is he?\\nPhoebe: Well, it\\'s this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold       down so he wouldn\\'t turn over and flash me.\\nJoey : Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got       for Ross.\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah.\\nJoey: She\\'s this really boring woman. She\\'s a teacher!\\nPhoebe: A teacher?\\nJoey: Yeah, yeah, she\\'s really into history and foreign movies... And oh,       oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?\\nPhoebe: Well, Ross does. What... You\\'re - you\\'re ruining the plan! Joey,       you\\'ve - you\\'ve fixed him up with his perfect woman!\\nJoey: Oh my god, you\\'re right!\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nJoey: She even reads for pleasure!\\nPhoebe: How do you even know a woman like that?\\nJoey: What? I\\'m not allowed to know smart women?\\nPhoebe: Joey.\\nJoey: I met her at the library. I went in to pee.\\nPhoebe: So now what do we do?\\nJoey: Well, okay, I\\'ll - I\\'ll just call her and tell her the date\\'s cancelled,       and find him somebody else.\\nPhoebe: What if we don\\'t find him somebody else? We\\'ll just tell her the       date\\'s off, but we don\\'t tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets       stood up!\\nJoey: Ooh...I hear that\\'s bad.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, so this is great! Rachel\\'s gonna have a terrible date, Ross       gets stood up, and then they\\'ll realise how good they have it together.\\nJoey: Ah, yes, The Plan!\\nPhoebe: It\\'s not Santa\\'s plan. No, it\\'s...\\nJoey: Yeah, you know, it\\'s not that fun.\\nPhoebe: No, I think we killed it.\\nChandler: Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I\\'ll go downstairs for a while.\\nChandler: No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. I didn\\'t go.       Don\\'t cry, it\\'s just a bit! I\\'m your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!\\nMonica: Okay, just so you know, I\\'m gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until       the sixth, so don\\'t touch yourself in the next 48 hours.\\nChandler: I don\\'t do that.\\nChandler: I\\'ll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nChandler: Today is the sixth.\\nMonica: No, it\\'s not.\\nChandler: Yes, it\\'s also 2003.\\nMonica: Oh my god. Today\\'s the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have       also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.\\nChandler: It\\'s okay. Go take the test and see if we\\'re okay.\\nMonica: Okay.\\nChandler: Tough crib.\\nMonica: Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There\\'s only one here.\\nChandler: I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.\\nMonica: Chandler!\\nChandler: I am not working. There\\'s not much to do around here!\\nRoss: Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,       dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?\\nWaiter: Uh, there\\'s a drunk Chinese guy.\\nRoss: Well, if I\\'m still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.\\nWaiter: Can I get you another glass of wine?\\nRoss: Nah, I don\\'t know if I should. I don\\'t wanna be drunk when I go home       alone.\\nWaiter: Got stood up, huh?\\nRoss: Yeah, it\\'s no big deal. It\\'s just a blind date.\\nWaiter: Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?\\nRoss: No!\\nMonica: We\\'re okay. I\\'m still ovulating.\\nChandler: Oh, good, because as of four o\\'clock this afternoon, I am not.\\nMonica: So, let\\'s do this.\\nChandler: I - I don\\'t think I can.\\nMonica: Come on. I know you\\'re not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.\\nChandler: Because of Emma.\\nMonica: Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you\\'re       right, we can\\'t do this. We can\\'t leave her alone.\\nChandler: Sorry.\\nMonica: Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware       of at this age?\\nChandler: Well, she\\'s aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...       canoodling in it.\\nMonica: Canoodling?\\nChandler: Well, I can\\'t say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front       of the B-A-B-Y.\\nMonica: I don\\'t know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn\\'t       so...\\nChandler: Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?\\nMonica: I guess you\\'re right.\\nChandler: You guess I\\'m right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you       wouldn\\'t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through       the window.\\nMonica: But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?\\nRachel: Wow, everything looks so good! I think I\\'m gonna have the chicken.\\nSteve : I - I just have to say this; you\\'re really beautiful.\\nRachel: Oh, well, that\\'s - that\\'s very sweet. Thank you.\\nSteve: I\\'m kind of funny looking.\\nRachel: What?\\nSteve: Oh, come on, you\\'re way out of my league. Everybody in here knows       it. Bet that guy over there\\'s probably saying, \"ooh, why she out with       him? He must be rich!\" Well, I\\'m not!\\nRachel : So, what do think you wanna order? I\\'m really       excited about that chicken.\\nSteve: I\\'m not funny either. So, if you were thinking, \"well, he\\'s       not that good-looking, but maybe we\\'ll have some laughs\"... That ain\\'t       gonna happen.\\nRachel: Well, come on, Steve; let\\'s not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now       wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.       That\\'s impressive.\\nSteve: I lost it. To drugs.\\nSteve: I silk-screen t-shirts now.\\nRachel: Really? What\\'s that like?\\nSteve: It\\'s really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That\\'s       right. I have no money, I\\'m not funny, I live in a studio apartment with       two other guys, and I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m infertile.\\nRachel : Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something       that you like about yourself.\\nSteve: I do like my hair.\\nRachel: Really?\\nPhoebe: Hello?\\nRachel: Phoebe, it\\'s me. I\\'m going to hunt you down and kill you!\\nPhoebe: Hey, Rach!\\nRachel: This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?\\nPhoebe: You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.\\nRachel: I don\\'t care! This guy is a nightmare!\\nPhoebe: Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he\\'s stoned.\\nRachel: He\\'s not stoned.\\nPhoebe: Did he go out for a cigarette?\\nRachel: Yeah, four times.\\nPhoebe: My dear, sweet Rach.\\nPhoebe : Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable       time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.\\nJoey: Oh, great, pretty soon they\\'ll be back together.\\nPhoebe: By the time anyone\\'s figured out what we\\'ve done, we\\'ll be in sunny       Mexico.  Oh, wait, that\\'s the end of a different plan.\\nMonica: She\\'s asleep. Chandler?\\nMonica: What are you doing?\\nChandler: Emma was doing it!\\nMonica: She\\'s asleep.\\nChandler: Ooh, she\\'s asleep, that means we can...\\nMonica: Yes, but we have to be fast.\\nChandler : Okay, I\\'ll try. And you can\\'t make any noise.\\nMonica : Okay, I\\'ll try.\\nJoey: Hello?\\nJoey: Emma? Hey! Hi!\\nJoey: How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why\\'s the       bedroom door closed?\\nJoey: You can\\'t have S-E-X, when you\\'re taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!\\nWaiter: I\\'ve got bad news. The Chinese guy left.\\nRoss: Eh, if it was meant to be, it\\'s meant to be.\\nWaiter: Look; you got stood up, who cares? We\\'re gonna show you a good time.       Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on       the house.\\nRoss: Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that\\'s nice. Although I was hoping to       have sex tonight.\\nWaiter: Ooh...\\nRoss: Just the crab cakes.\\nWaiter #2: What are you       doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can\\'t do that.\\nWaiter: Just get out of here, okay?\\nRoss: What\\'s - what\\'s going on?\\nWaiter: Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on       how long it\\'ll take before you give up and go home.\\nRoss: What? You - you\\'re making money off my misery?\\nWaiter: Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.\\nRoss: This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.       Now, if you\\'ll wrap up my free crab cakes, I\\'ll be on my way.\\nMonica: Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.\\nChandler: I think we may have really done it this time.\\nMonica: Oh, I wish I didn\\'t have to wait to take a pregnancy test.\\nChandler: You may wanna get some more of those too.\\nChandler: Where\\'s Emma?\\nMonica: Oh my god, where\\'s Emma? Where\\'s Emma?\\nChandler: Don\\'t ask me, I was in there canoodling you!\\nMonica: Okay, okay, I\\'m sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.       You go look across the hall, and I\\'ll call her cell.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nMonica: Hey, you better hope that we\\'re pregnant, because one way or another,       we\\'re giving a baby back to Rachel.\\nSteve : I - I can\\'t believe Im crying in front of you. You must       think I\\'m so pathetic.\\nRachel: No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.\\nSteve: Really?\\nRachel: Don\\'t touch my coat!\\nRachel: Oh, sorry, it\\'s my phone. Hello?\\nMonica : Hey, Rach, how\\'s it going?\\nRachel: Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!\\nRachel  What\\'s up?\\nMonica: Hey, did you stop by here?\\nRachel: No.\\nMonica: Oh my god, then...\\nMonica: Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!\\nRachel: What? What do you mean, \"there you are\"? Where was she?\\nMonica: Oh, we were playing \"peek-a-boo.\" She just  she loves       it when I\\'m dramatic.\\nMonica : Why the hell did you take her?\\nJoey: Because you two were having sex!\\nMonica: No, we weren\\'t!\\nJoey: Don\\'t you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler\\'s hair.        You are so lazy. Can\\'t you get on top for once?\\nChandler: All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica\\'s       ovulating.\\nJoey: Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in       the next room. I\\'m gonna have to tell Rachel about this.\\nChandler: No, no, no.\\nMonica: No, please don\\'t. Please, Joey. She will kill us!\\nJoey: Hey, I gotta! Unless...\\nMonica: Unless what?\\nJoey: Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.\\nChandler: What? Why?\\nJoey: Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody\\'s gotta carry on my family       name.\\nChandler: Your family name is Tribbiani.\\nJoey:  You almost had me.\\nRachel: Well, uh...\\nSteve: Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you       like to make love to me?\\nRachel: Really, really not.\\nSteve: Eh, it\\'s just as well. Doesn\\'t work anyway.\\nRachel: All right, well that\\'s good to know. Good night, Steve.\\nRoss: Hey, what\\'s wrong?\\nRachel: I just had a rough night.\\nRoss: Oh. Crab cake?\\nRachel: Eww!\\nRoss: Well, what happened?\\nRachel: Oh, well, I...It\\'s kind of weird talking to you about this, but...\\nRoss: Monica told me you had a blind date.\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nRoss: I did, too.\\nRachel: Oh.\\nRoss: But is it technically a date if the other person doesn\\'t show up?\\nRachel: Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?\\nRoss: Why does everyone keep saying that?\\nRachel: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn\\'t shown       up.\\nRoss: That bad?\\nRachel: Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be       appropriate to give me this.\\nRoss: Female body inspector? What size is that?\\nPhoebe: Now, wait a minute. So, they\\'re gonna name their first child Joey?\\nJoey: Uh-huh.\\nPhoebe: How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?\\nJoey: It\\'s easy, you just walk in on them having sex.\\nPhoebe: Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.\\nPhoebe: Oh my god! Look, it\\'s Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.\\nPhoebe: Don\\'t, don\\'t do the plan-laugh.\\nRoss: The first date we\\'ve had in months, and they were both such disasters.\\nRachel: Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would       set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you       up on a date that didn\\'t even show.\\nRoss: Wait a minute; you don\\'t think it was intentional? I mean, that\\'s       just stupid.\\nJoey: We\\'re geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they\\'re really       bonding.\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, they\\'re falling in love all over again.\\nPhoebe: Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.       They\\'re coming this way. Run!\\nJoey: Where?\\nPhoebe: Mexico!\\nEnd credits.\\nJoey: Can you believe they\\'re still not here?\\nRoss: I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the       chances?\\nJoey: I know, I\\'m so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?\\nWaiter: What?\\nJoey: We\\'ve been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.\\nWaiter: Guys, give it a rest. Nobody\\'s betting on you tonight. Although we       do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.\\nSteve: I have such fat hands!\\n======== 09-15\\n Chandler:   End\\n======== 09-16\\nTranscribed by: r3v3LaT1oN with corrections and additional information by   Keith Owen\\nChandler: Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?\\nMonica: I know...God. I haven\\'t seen my savings take a hit like this since   I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all   our money?\\nChandler: I\\'m not sure what they did, but I\\'m inclined to blame Enron.\\nMonica: I guess with you doing the internship, we\\'re just spending more than   we\\'re bringing in.\\nChandler: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.\\nMonica: Oh, But you\\'re finally doing something that you love! I can\\'t ask   you to give that up. Though it\\'d be nice if the thing that you love was y\\'know...   finding gold.\\nChandler: You know what? You know what? I think we\\'re making too big a deal   out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next   month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey\\'s   refrigerator for a change. You\\'re chef... what can you make out of backing   soda and beer?\\nMonica: Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.\\nChandler: No! We\\'re not borrowing money.\\nMonica: Why not?\\nChandler: Because we don\\'t do that. We are Bings! And if there\\'s one thing   my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool   house... but the other thing was never borrow money.\\nMonica: Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.\\nChandler: That\\'s right! I do! And I\\'m your man. And I\\'m going to get us through   this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.\\nOpening Credits\\nMike: I\\'m gonna go.\\nPhoebe: Why??\\nMike: I haven\\'t been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more   clothes.\\nPhoebe: Oh...you don\\'t have to go, I have something that will fit you.\\nMike: I put that tube top on as a joke.\\nPhoebe: I want you to stay.\\nMike: I want to stay too but I\\'ve gone as bad as much use out of these boxers   as I can..\\nPhoebe: Why don\\'t you turn them inside ou...\\nMike: Done it.  I\\'ll be back in a couple   of hours.\\nPhoebe: I\\'ll miss you.\\nMike: Me too.  You know   what? I just realised something. I don\\'t wanna go home.\\nPhoebe: Great! Ok...I\\'ll go get the tube top.\\nMike: No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and   partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I\\'m   there, It\\'s just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?\\nPhoebe: Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say \"Hell   yeah!\"\\nMike: So we\\'re doing it?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! Let\\'s do it! Let\\'s live together!  Oh god, we\\'re really going to move in together!\\nMike: Yeah!\\nPhoebe: I\\'ve always wanted to live with a guy. \"Pick up your socks!\" \"Put   down the toilet seat!\" \"No! We\\'re not having sex anymore!\" It\\'s   gonna be fun!\\nMonica: Hey Joey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nMonica: Listen...I need to know that what I\\'m about to ask you, will never   get back to Chandler.\\nJoey: I\\'d be lying if I said I haven\\'t thought about it myself. Chandler is   my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.\\nMonica:  Ok first of all...It would be great. But that\\'s   not what I\\'m here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.\\nJoey: Aww, I don\\'t know Monica y\\'know... erm... lending friends money is always   a mistake.\\nMonica: But Chandler lent you money!\\nJoey: And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.\\nMonica: Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.\\nJoey: Oh...how much?\\nMonica: Two thousand dollars?\\nJoey: Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?\\nMonica: Yeah...\\nJoey: That\\'s right I am!\\nRachel: Hi you guys!\\nJoey & Monica: Hey!\\nJoey: Oo...what\\'s in the bag?\\nRachel: Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this   place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment.\\nJoey: Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y\\'know, when   I was a kid it was like.. \"Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!\" or   er.. \"Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!\" Huh!\\nMonica: Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?\\nRachel: No. I was just going to do this myself.\\nJoey: You\\'re gonna do it?\\nRachel: Yeah, Why? You don\\'t think a woman can do this?\\nJoey: Oh, women can. You can\\'t.\\nRachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?\\nMonica: You\\'re a pig. And you can\\'t do this.\\nRachel: Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!\\nJoey: The hardware store is right down the street.\\nRachel: There is a hardware store right down the street?\\nPhoebe: Hey you guys! Ok, we\\'ve got great news.\\nMike: Phoebe and I are moving in together.\\nMonica, Chandler, Ross: Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!\\nPhoebe: I know it\\'s so exciting! You know I\\'ve never lived with a guy before.\\nMonica: Well you know it\\'s just like living with a girl. Only they don\\'t steal   your makeup. Unless they\\'re playing \"This is what my sister would look   like\"\\nChandler: Yeah.... she\\'s not so cute.\\nMike: I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom.\\nPhoebe: Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.\\nMike: Yes dear.\\nMonica: Is that a bit you guys do?\\nPhoebe: Uh huh...we\\'re playing you two.\\nMonica: We don\\'t do that! Tell her we don\\'t do that!\\nChandler: Yes dear.\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe you guys are moving in together. That\\'s, that\\'s great!   I mean...I\\'m happy for you guys..\\nMonica: I hear wedding bells.\\nPhoebe: Monica slow down! Ok? I\\'m just excited to be living with him. You   know I mean, I don\\'t know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.   Y\\'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that   highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house   in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send   Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.\\nRoss: Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.\\nPhoebe: I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a   soccer mom!\\nMike: You ready to go?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! You bet roomy!\\nMonica: Don\\'t you mean..groomy?\\nMike: What are you talking about?\\nPhoebe: Oh please, these guys, we haven\\'t even moved in yet and they have   us picking out china patterns.\\nPhoebe: China patterns!!!!!\\nRachel: This is easy...Can\\'t do this!\\nChandler: Hey Joe!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can\\'t tell Monica anything   about it.\\nJoey: I thought you didn\\'t have secrets from Monica.\\nChandler: And that would have made the official party line.  Monica   and I are having a little financial trouble.\\nJoey: Yeah, I know.\\nChandler: What? What do you mean you know?\\nJoey: Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you\\'re not working and   the economy is bad.\\nChandler: Oh! Right.\\nJoey:  That\\'s the fastest I have ever thought!\\nChandler: Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.\\nJoey: Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?\\nChandler: Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!\\nJoey: Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your   rent is.\\nChandler: Oh ok.\\nJoey:  I am on fire!\\nChandler  Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars?   Did Monica borrow money from you?\\nJoey: Err... Kind of.\\nChandler: I can\\'t believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?\\nJoey: Oh no no no no no... It wasn\\'t... It wasn\\'t because of your money problems,   it was for something for her.\\nChandler: What?\\nJoey: Something personal.\\nChandler: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she   wouldn\\'t tell me about?\\nWoman: Excuse me.\\nJoey: Boob job.\\nMonica: I don\\'t want her to get a boob job! That\\'s crazy!\\nJoey: Well it\\'s...It\\'s not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would   be crazy.\\nMike: Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica\\'s little \"groomy\" joke.\\nPhoebe: Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it\\'s   a play on the word roomy.\\nMike: I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...   maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you\\'re not   expecting a proposal, right?\\nPhoebe: Oh no! No no! Not at all. We\\'re just moving in right now. See where   it goes.\\nMike: Yeah well, that\\'s the thing. For me it\\'s as far as it can ever go.\\nPhoebe: What do you mean?\\nMike: Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married   again.\\nPhoebe: Oh. Wow.\\nMike: It\\'s just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of   lost faith in the whole idea.\\nPhoebe: Was it really that bad?\\nMike: At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....\\nPhoebe: Ok, well that\\'s bad. But don\\'t you think it might be different with   someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in   the ocean.\\nMike: Look it\\'s not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time   I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!\\nPhoebe: But it\\'s just...\\nMike: Look Phoebe, It\\'s not about you. I just never wanna get married again.\\nPhoebe: Oh!\\nMike: I\\'m sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together   isn\\'t the best idea.\\nPhoebe: No! I definitely don\\'t wanna get married. No I just wanted to make   sure you didn\\'t want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start   changing your mind there\\'s gonna be hell to pay mister!\\nMike: Trust me, I will never...\\nPhoebe: Yeah I get that.\\nRachel: Hi!\\nMonica: So you gave in and decided to call someone?\\nRachel: Yeah, I don\\'t know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.\\nHandyman: You\\'re all set.\\nRachel: Oh thank you so much.\\nHandyman: Thanks.....\\nChandler: Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.\\nRachel: Don\\'t look at me I never get his jokes.\\nMonica: Thank you?\\nChandler: Oh no..don\\'t thank me. Thank you. You know there\\'s not one thing   I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...   single things.\\nMonica: Ok, you\\'re being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?\\nChandler: No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.\\nMonica: Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They\\'re still   ok.\\nChandler: Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.   I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn\\'t change it. At all. And more   specifically, I wouldn\\'t want anything to get any bigger.\\nMonica: Okay...\\nChandler: I mean, You wouldn\\'t want any part of me to get any bigger would   you? Don\\'t answer that.\\nRachel: Just when you thought that dude couldn\\'t get any wierder.\\nMonica: I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know! I mean, what brought that on?\\nMonica: Oh my god. We\\'re trying to get pregnant so he\\'s probably starting   to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.\\nRachel: No you really think that\\'s what it is?\\nMonica: You heard him! \"No bigger!\" \"You\\'re perfect!\" \"Just   don\\'t get any bigger!\" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling   coach. You know what? I\\'m going to have to talk to Chandler.\\nRachel: Yeah! If you don\\'t I will! Of course your body\\'s gonna change. Your   breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you\\'re gonna lose   bladder control.  God! It\\'s just such a magical time!\\nPhoebe: Hi\\nRoss: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.\\nRoss: Oh great now you\\'re seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for   all hanging out but to come to my home!\\nPhoebe: No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.\\nRoss: Why?\\nPhoebe: Mike doesn\\'t ever wanna get married.\\nRoss: Never?\\nPhoebe: Never.\\nRoss: wow, are you still going to move in with him?\\nPhoebe: I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn\\'t really   that big a deal. You know that I won\\'t, I won\\'t be missing out on anything.   That marriage stinks!\\nRoss: Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight   and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.\\nPhoebe: That\\'s not how you really feel is it?\\nRoss: No, I\\'m sorry. Look I don\\'t think that\\'s what you wanna hear right now   but I can\\'t help it. I love marriage.\\nPhoebe: Seriously? You divorce-o?\\nRoss: If you have to call me name, I prefer \"Ross the Divorcer\".   It\\'s just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn\\'t exactly work out. But I love   to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before   she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I\\'m sorry.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s ok that\\'s how you feel.\\nRoss: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have   so much fun and you love Mike.\\nPhoebe: I do love Mike.\\nRoss: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and   you know what? You should be. It\\'s a big deal!\\nPhoebe: Yeah I guess you\\'re right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.\\nRoss: The Divorcer, to the rescue!\\nPhoebe: It\\'s not cooler.\\nRoss: Yeah I just hurt it.\\nJoey: Rach?!  So I can\\'t do anything I like????\\nChandler: Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn\\'t change   a thing. Not a thing.\\nMonica: Honey?\\nChandler: Yeah?\\nMonica: About that? Erm...I\\'m going to change.\\nChandler: But honey you don\\'t have to.\\nMonica: I\\'m going to get bigger!\\nChandler: Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!\\nRachel: Argh. fascist\\nMonica: Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!   And you know what? It\\'s not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger   too.\\nChandler: your ass?!?!?\\nRachel: Man, don\\'t be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!\\nChandler: They...do that?\\nMonica: It\\'s kind of a package deal!\\nChandler: God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?\\nMonica: I thought I was something that we both wanted!\\nChandler: Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get   on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?\\nRachel: Oh my god Chandler! If you can\\'t handle this, what are you going to   be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present   that\\'s shooting out of her!?\\nChandler:  What?\\nRachel: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?\\nJoey: Because she is!\\nMonica: Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.\\nJoey: Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!\\nMonica, Rachel, Chandler: It\\'s over/Joe!\\nJoey: OK so I\\'m out four thousand dollars and nobody\\'s boobs are getting any   bigger?\\nRoss: Hey! What do you guys think about this. \"Ross: The Divorce-Force\".\\nPhoebe: Better.\\nMike: Very cool.\\nRoss: Hey Pheebs, you know I\\'m i\\'m really glad you came to talk to me the   other day and I hope I was a little helpful.\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.\\nRoss: Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised   I don\\'t think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.\\nPhoebe: What do you mean?\\nRoss: Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in   the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly   picture yourself in a Volvo?\\nPhoebe: They are awfully boxy...\\nRoss: I don\\'t know you\\'d be so bored with marriage. I mean it\\'s so... normal.\\nPhoebe: Uh huh.\\nRoss: Hey hey, can I help?\\nChandler: Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow   hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets   really tricky.\\nRoss: You know sometimes your words... they hurt.\\nJoey: Hey uh, where do you guys want this?\\nRachel: Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  I   mean not for me because i\\'m only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.\\nPhoebe: Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there\\'s no wiggle   room? None at all?\\nMike: No but... You don\\'t want to get married either right?\\nPhoebe: Right. Except that I do want to get married.\\nJoey:  Couldn\\'t have this conversation down at the truck huh?\\nMike: You wanna get married?\\nPhoebe: Someday.\\nChandler: Aaaaand....... hernia.\\nPhoebe: I haven\\'t exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was   missing out on anything but it just feels that now it\\'s my turn some of the   regular stuff.\\nMike: But if you wanna get married why didn\\'t you say something before?\\nPhoebe: Because I just didn\\'t know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and   I wanted to live with you.\\nMike: I want to live with you too! Let\\'s do that!\\nPhoebe: But I don\\'t think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn\\'t know what   was gonna happen, but I can\\'t move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.\\nMike: Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind   about marriage.\\nPhoebe: Are you gonna change yours?\\nMike: No.\\nPhoebe: Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.\\nMike: But I don\\'t want this to end.\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t want it to end either.\\nMike: I can\\'t believe this is gonna end. I guess I\\'ll have my stuff packed   up.\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nMike: Ok... so... Goodbye.\\nChandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica: Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!\\nRachel: I\\'m so sorry Pheebs.\\nMonica: We\\'re all sorry...\\nChandler: Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won\\'t have to live with   this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.\\nEnding Credits\\nJoey: AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...  Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i\\'ll be able   to get in here again!\\nEnd\\n======== 09-17\\nAired: 3/13/2003 Teleplay by: Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones  Story by: Robert Carlock Directed by: Gary Halvorson Transcribed by: Eleonora, Pheeboh and Vanessa\\nChandler: Hey!

It\\'s a new alumni website for college! It\\'s cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you\\'re up to.\\nChandler: Great, a faster way to tell people that I\\'m unemployed and childless .\\nRoss: It\\'s actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?\\nChandler: The tall girl who wouldn\\'t sleep with you?\\nRoss: Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...\\nChandler: Bet she\\'d sleep with you now...\\nRoss: No... I already e-mailed her.\\nChandler: Let me see what you wrote about yourself: \"Doctor Paleontology, two kids... \"  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you\\'ve one very similar interest!\\nRoss: You know what? I\\'m gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRoss:\\nChandler: Maybe we finish this for him!  \"Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She\\'s now my girlfriend. I don\\'t care what society says.

How was basketball?\\nJoey: Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!\\nRachel: Oh, no! Who did that?\\nJoey: Chandler... hey...\\nRachel: She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That\\'s all right?

Oh, I really miss Mike!\\nChandler: Oh, I\\'m so sorry!\\nPhoebe: Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can\\'t think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...\\nChandler: You\\'re not gonna need my help?\\nPhoebe: Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I\\'m ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I\\'m gonna come to you.\\nChandler: Oh good, \\'cause I\\'ve already thought of 3... 4! I\\'ve just thought of a fourth\\nPhoebe: Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn\\'t be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I\\'m gonna miss him so much. I\\'m gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.\\nMonica: Ok, you got it!\\nPhoebe:  Unless... Maybe it\\'s too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn\\'t mean we still can\\'t have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.\\nMonica: Really? If that\\'s what you want...\\nPhoebe: That was a test and you just failed.\\nMonica: Damn it! Rookie mistake!\\nRoss:  I have sex with dinosaurs??\\nChandler: I believe I read that somewhere!\\nRoss: That only is not funny, it\\'s physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I\\'d have to have a six foot long...   It\\'s not funny!!\\nChandler: I respectfully disagree.\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe you put that on my alumni page!\\nChandler: Who cares? Nobody reads those things\\nRoss: You\\'d better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.\\nChandler: I don\\'t have a page.\\nRoss: Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!\\nJoey: Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma\\'s chubby little hands wrapped around ya.\\nRachel: : Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!\\nJoey: It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay Rach, it\\'s me. Put down the scrunchy.\\nRachel: What are you doing?\\nJoey: Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.\\nRachel: Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I\\'m up I\\'m going to go to the bathroom.\\nJoey:  This isn\\'t over.\\nMonica: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...   \"gay as the day is long\"?\\nChandler: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.\\nMonica: But that\\'s clearly a joke. This could easily be true.\\nChandler: Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.\\nMonica:  Hello? No, he\\'s not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.\\nChandler: Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! .\\nMonica: What are you doing?\\nChandler: Oh, you\\'ll see my friend.\\nRoss:  I\\'m dead?\\nChandler:  And so young.\\nRoss: Posting that I died? That really isn\\'t funny.\\nChandler: Well, how you died was funny.\\nRoss: Oh please, hit by a blimp?\\nChandler: It kills over one americans every year.\\nRoss: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I\\'m dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You\\'re messing with people\\'s feelings here.\\nChandler: You wanna talk about people\\'s feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn\\'t be able to go with him to Key West!\\nRoss: You\\'ve really crossed the line here, but that\\'s okay, it\\'s ok \\'cause I\\'m on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That\\'s right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.\\nPhoebe: God, I wish Mike were here.\\nMonica: Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?\\nMonica: What are you, animals? It\\'s 4 o\\'clock in the afternoon!\\nPhoebe: I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there\\'s no harm in that.\\nMonica: Phoebe, that\\'s how it starts. I don\\'t need to eat the cake, I\\'ll just smell the icing... why don\\'t I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you\\'re 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you\\'re going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you\\'re going to want to get back together with him. I know that\\'s not what you want.  Give me your phone.\\nPhoebe: Here.\\nMonica: And now your cell.\\nPhoebe: Okay\\nMonica: This is your cellphone?\\nPhoebe: Yes.\\nMonica: This is your current cellphone?\\nPhoebe: Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.\\nMonica: Phoebe, where\\'s your purse?\\nMonica: No, no! Give it to me!\\nPhoebe: You can\\'t have it.\\nMonica: Give it to me!\\nPhoebe: No\\nMonica: I\\'ll go in there.\\nPhoebe:  Oh yeah.\\nMonica: Phoebe come here\\nMonica: Haha!\\nPhoebe: Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!\\nJoey: Hey, look who\\'s here! It\\'s Joey, and he brought home a friend.\\nRachel: Joey, Emma\\'s right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.\\nJoey: No, no, it\\'s not a girl, it\\'s...  a brand new Hugsy!\\nRachel: Oh that\\'s so great, now Emma has two Hugsy\\'s.\\nJoey: No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don\\'t know, I guess I\\'ll just take it back.\\nRachel: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...\\nJoey: Make the transfer!\\nRachel: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can\\'t find it?\\nJoey: Oh, no don\\'t worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.\\nRachel: Oh, I don\\'t think she likes the new Hugsy.\\nJoey: But he\\'s the same.\\nRachel: Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.\\nJoey: But he\\'s the same.\\nRachel: Joey, come on!\\nJoey: He\\'s the same!\\nJoey:  You\\'re not the same!\\nMonica: Haha!\\nPhoebe: You know, it\\'s a lot less surprising to do that after I\\'ve buzzed you into the building.\\nMonica: So Phoebe, why are there men\\'s shoes by the door.\\nPhoebe: Those are my shoes.\\nMonica: Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.\\nPhoebe: Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I\\'m actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.\\nMonica: Who\\'s that?\\nPhoebe: I ordered Chinese food.\\nPhoebe: What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?\\nMonica:  What are you doing here?\\nMike: Phoebe called me.\\nMonica: Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.\\nMonica: Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?\\nPhoebe: There is a speakerphone on the base unit...\\nMonica: Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!\\nMike: Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...\\nMonica:  This doesn\\'t concern you!!\\nMike: Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!\\nMonica: Look, guys, you can\\'t do this, it\\'s just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.\\nPhoebe: Not if nothing happens. Why can\\'t... why can\\'t we just hang out as friends?\\nMonica: Sure! If you\\'re just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I\\'ll join ya. You know, I\\'m your friend .\\nPhoebe: Sit down.\\nMonica: Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!\\nMike:  So how\\'ve you been?\\nMonica: I\\'ve been pretty good!\\nMike:  You look really beautiful.\\nPhoebe: Thanks, you look good too.\\nMonica: Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!\\nPhoebe: So how\\'s the piano playing going?\\nMike: Actually I\\'ve been playing a lot of love songs lately. I\\'ve missed you.\\nPhoebe: I\\'ve missed you too.\\nMonica: You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!\\nChandler: Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don\\'t tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?\\nRoss: uhu uhu, check this out.\\nChandler: Huh! So that\\'s what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You\\'re not actually going to send these out are ya?\\nRoss: Eh..actually no, I don\\'t need to because your little \"Ross is dead\" joke didn\\'t work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I\\'m dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I\\'m dead!?\\nChandler: No, come on, you know that\\'s not true.\\nRoss: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn\\'t get one response! And I\\'m dead!\\nChandler: Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!\\nChandler: Alright look, let\\'s think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you\\'re dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.\\nRoss: You\\'re right. There isn\\'t a decent outlet.\\nChandler: Right, I mean, come on, I\\'m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.\\nRoss: Exactly!!\\nChandler: Ross, what\\'re you... what\\'re you... what are you doing? You\\'re having a memorial service for yourself!?\\nRoss: No! That would be stupid! You\\'re having it for me!\\nChandler: Ross, don\\'t press send, don\\'t press se... !\\nRoss: oh, too late, too late! It\\'s sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...\\nRachel: I\\'m trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?\\nJoey: Original or crappy?\\nRachel: Original.\\nJoey: No, sorry haven\\'t seen him.\\nRachel: Then what\\'s that big lump under your covers?\\nJoey: It\\'s Monica, ok?\\nRachel: That\\'s not Monica!\\nJoey: Alright!! Fine! It\\'s original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he\\'s mine and I need him..\\nRachel:  Oh God.\\nJoey: ... she\\'s being unreasonable!\\nRachel:  It\\'s because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!\\nJoey: It does?\\nRachel: Yeah! And she\\'s comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.\\nJoey: Really? She... she loves me?\\nRachel: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don\\'t worry. Emma will totally understand. I won\\'t... but whatever .\\nJoey: Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.\\nRachel: Oooh... you\\'re sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma, look who\\'s baaack!\\nJoey: Look forget it forget it...  I can\\'t do it.\\nRachel: Are you gonna...  you\\'re going to take Hugsy away from a little child?\\nJoey: How do you think I got him in the first place?\\nMonica: Alright you two, I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don\\'t want anything going on while I\\'m gone. Here\\'s a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.\\nMike: I\\'ve missed you so much! No, I\\'m not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.\\nPhoebe: I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?\\nMike: It can\\'t be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped.\\nMonica:  Kiss him, you fool!!\\nPhoebe: What?\\nMonica: Didn\\'t you hear that speech? If you don\\'t kiss him then I will!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I missed you so much!\\nStrange man:  I knew you\\'d be here!\\nMike: Oh, crap!\\nPhoebe: Who is this?\\nMike: My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.\\nMonica: Hi, that\\'s what I\\'m doing for Phoebe!\\nManny: Well, you are not doing a very good job!\\nMonica: Excuse me?\\nManny: What\\'s with the kissing?\\nMonica: Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.\\nManny: Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!\\nMonica: You didn\\'t hear the speech!\\nManny: I\\'ve heard the speech:  \"if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... \"\\nMonica: Hey, it was very moving! You\\'re just heartless!\\nManny: You\\'re weak!\\nMonica: You\\'re... weird!\\nManny: Your pants are undone!\\nMonica: Oh !\\nManny:  Where did they go?\\nMonica: Damn it!\\nManny: Oh we blew it. I blame myself.\\nMonica: And I blame you too.\\nRoss: It\\'s been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!\\nChandler: There you go! Someone came!\\nRoss: Ok, ok! I\\'m gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!\\nMonica: Hi, glad you could come.\\nChandler:  Please, come in.\\nTom: Hi, you\\'re Chandler Bing, right? I\\'m Tom Gordon, I was in your class.\\nChandler: Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.\\nTom: Thanks... uh... I\\'m so sorry about Ross, it\\'s...\\nChandler: At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps\\nRoss: Who is he?\\nChandler: Some guy, Tom Gordon.\\nRoss: I don\\'t remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.\\nMonica: So, did you know Ross well?\\nTom: Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler\\'s news. D\\'you know if he\\'s seeing anyone?\\nMonica:  Yes, he is. Me.\\nTom: What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?\\nChandler:\\nTom:  Hey, listen. Call me.\\nChandler: Ok!\\nRoss:  I\\'m dead and no one cares?\\nMonica: I look like a man??\\nChandler: Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!\\nRoss: It isn\\'t ridiculous, look around! No one\\'s here!\\nChandler: You gave them one day\\'s notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it\\'s probably the way you stand!\\nRoss: Yes, you\\'re right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn\\'t have an impact on anyone?\\nChandler: Oh, that\\'s not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it\\'s 15 years later and we\\'re still best friends. Doesn\\'t that count for something?\\nRoss:  Yeah...\\n Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!\\nChandler: I\\'m sure it\\'s somebody for you. Now, go hide.\\nKori: Hi. I\\'m here for Ross Geller\\'s memorial service.\\nChandler: Kori? Kori Weston?\\nKori: Yeah...\\nChandler: Wow! You look amazing!\\nKori: And you are...\\nChandler: Chandler, Chandler Bing. I\\'m not gay, I\\'m not gay at all.\\nMonica: You are married though.\\nChandler: Don\\'t listen to him, he\\'s in a really bad mood!\\nKori: I can\\'t believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.\\nChandler: I didn\\'t know Ross and you were so close.\\nKori: We weren\\'t but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.\\nChandler: I\\'m sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I\\'m sure he\\'s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.\\nKori: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.\\nRoss:  But you didn\\'t! I\\'m still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It\\'s a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!\\nKori: You sick freak, who does that? I can\\'t believe I had a crush on you!\\nRoss: Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!\\nEnding Credits\\nRoss:  Monica?\\n======== 09-18\\nTeleplay: Sherry Bilsing - Graham & Ellen Plummer Story: Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones Directed by: Gary Halvorson Transcribed by: Eleonora, Pheeboh, Roni & Vanessa\\nJoey: Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?\\nMonica: Ok.\\nJoey: Alright!\\nMonica: But ehm...what is it not?\\nJoey:  A place to entertain my lady friends.\\nMonica: And what else is it not?\\nJoey:  A place to eat spaghetti.\\nMonica: Very good!  What do you need it for anyway?\\nJoey: Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don\\'t sell tickets here in New York, so...\\nRachel: Oh! So you\\'re driving up to Connecticut?\\nJoey: Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.\\nMonica: Hey, maybe I\\'ll drive you up there! I\\'d like to buy some tickets myself!\\nJoey: Uh!\\nMonica: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.\\nChandler: Yeah, because if I was at my old job we\\'d say 300 million? No thank you!\\nPhoebe: Hey will you get me tickets too?\\nRachel: Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don\\'t we all pitch in 50 bucks, we\\'ll pool our money together and then if we win, we\\'ll split it!\\nEveryone except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!\\nRoss: No thanks!\\nPhoebe: You don\\'t wanna win the lottery?\\nRoss: Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.\\nChandler: Still on Amelia Earhart?\\nRoss: The woman just vanished!\\nJoey: Seriously, Ross, you don\\'t want in on this?\\nRoss: No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.\\nChandler: Yes but there\\'s six of us so we\\'d only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.\\nJoey: I like those odds!\\nRoss: Seriously you guys, I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that\\'s such a bunch of boohaki.\\nChandler:  Boohaki?\\nRoss: Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we\\'re trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.\\nRachel: Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.\\nMonica: How do you know she\\'s gonna start talking?\\nRachel: Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I\\'m saying.\\nChandler: Kinda like Joey.\\nJoey: What\\'s that now?\\nOpening credits\\nMonica: God! Look at all these tickets! It\\'s so exciting! You know I haven\\'t won anything since the sixth grade.\\nChandler: Pie eating contest?\\nMonica: Oh! You assume because I was heavy that\\'s the only way I could win something?\\nChandler: No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.\\nMonica: That was a good day!\\nRoss: They\\'re towing your car, they\\'re towing your car!!\\nMonica: I\\'m parked in a garage on Morton!\\nRoss: They\\'re towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.\\nJoey:  Where\\'s Emma? Who has Emma!?\\nRachel: Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!\\nJoey: I was?\\nRacel: Yes and you talked to her...\\nJoey: I did?\\nRachel: She dropped off a casserole?\\nJoey: Oh yeah! The casserole lady.\\nMonica: So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?\\nRoss: Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!\\nChandler:\\nRoss: Think he washed his hands?\\nChandler: Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?\\nRachel: What\\'s going on?\\nMonica: Chandler is supposed to find out if he\\'s getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.\\nJoey: Ooh! Tough odds!\\nRoss: Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!\\nJoey: Look who\\'s coming around!\\nChandler: Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.\\nJoey: Did you get it?\\nChandler: One of the slots got filled.\\nJoey: By you!?\\nChandler: Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.\\nMonica: Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!\\nChandler: Yeah I know.\\nRachel: Well, there\\'s two spots left right?\\nChandler: Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don\\'t care about Charlie.\\nPhoebe: Hey you guys! Ok, you\\'re not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!\\nMonica: Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.\\nRoss: A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!\\nMonica: Alright, who wants to do it?\\nPhoebe: Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It\\'s really not fair either! You know, just because we don\\'t eat the meat doesn\\'t mean we don\\'t like to play with the carcasses!\\nMonica: Ok, hey Rach?\\nRachel: Oh no, I\\'m good, I don\\'t wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.\\nJoey: I\\'ll do it!! It\\'ll get the casserole stink off of mine.\\nPhoebe: I hope I win!\\nMonica: Well, it doesn\\'t really matter ... you\\'re both wishing for the same thing, right?\\nJoey: I can\\'t tell you what I\\'m wishing for! Else...you know...won\\'t come true!\\nMonica: Right! .. but we \"know\" what you\\'re wishing for!\\nJoey: Can\\'t really say!\\nMonica: I understand, but you\\'re wishing for what we think you\\'re wishing for, aren\\'t you?\\nJoey: I\\'m not really comfortable with these questions!\\nRachel, Chandler and Monica: Please, just do it!\\nPhoebe: One, two, three!\\nJoey: I won, hey!\\nRoss: You know what, I\\'m sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!\\nRachel: You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?\\nRoss: Uh, you\\'re not gonna win.\\nRachel: Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we\\'re gonna be all like \"oh everybody, let\\'s take our helicopters up to the cape\" and you\\'re gonna be all like \"oh, I can\\'t guys, I\\'ll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai\"\\nRoss: Ok, I\\'ve heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.\\nChandler: I can see the headline now: \"Lottery winners\\' friend filled with regret eats own arm\".\\nRoss: Why would I eat my own arm?\\nChandler: Well you wouldn\\'t, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.\\nMonica: You know what, Ross? I\\'m gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.\\nRoss: Why?\\nMonica: Because I know that you think the lottery is \"boohaki\" but we\\'re all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you\\'re my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.\\nRoss: You don\\'t have to do that, I\\'ll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that\\'s so sweet! Come here\\nPhoebe: Get a room!\\nChandler: Ok, so now that you\\'re in, what are you gonna do if we win?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know, probably just invest it.\\nChandler: Ooh! Calm down ...\\nJoey: Seriously, that\\'s your fantasy? To invest it?\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'m sorry, did I say \"invest it\"? I meant \"be cool and piss it all away\"\\nJoey: Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!\\nRachel: I don\\'t really care about the Knicks.\\nJoey: Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.\\nRachel:  You would do that? I never get picked!\\nChandler: You know, I\\'m not sure a sports team is the way to go.\\nJoey: You\\'re not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can\\'t believe you\\'re taking this away from me!\\nChandler: You\\'re right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.\\nRoss:  Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?\\nChandler:  Uh ... Mommy?\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'ve gotten into the habit of calling Rachel \"Mommy\" when we\\'re around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...\\nRachel: I\\'m hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.\\nRoss: Although if we\\'re gonna do that, we should probably call me \"Daddy\" too.\\nPhoebe: Oooh, I like that, \"daddy\"\\nRoss: I ... I was just talking about Rachel.\\nPhoebe:  Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?\\nRoss:  no I can\\'t.\\nChandler: Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.\\nJoey: Dude, I\\'m sorry. But hey, there\\'s one spot left, right?\\nChandler: Well no, Charlie\\'s gonna get that.\\nMonica: Hey, don\\'t say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!\\nChandler: He\\'s the boss\\'s son.\\nMonica: Come on, lottery!!\\nRachel: Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.\\nMonica: Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we\\'ve won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?  Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.\\nRachel: Ooh, I have another idea!\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, idea time is over.\\nPhoebe: Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nChandler: What about the ones you have on the nightstand?\\nMonica: There are no tickets on the nightstand!\\nChandler: Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.\\nMonica: Un, no you didn\\'t! You must be mistaken!\\nChandler: Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!\\nMonica: Chandler, sense the tone!!\\nRachel: Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!\\nMonica: Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.\\nPhoebe: Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe this, I thought we were all in this together!\\nMonica: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!\\nRoss: 3 minutes ago!!! I don\\'t know why that\\'s important ...\\nJoey: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?\\nMonica: When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!\\nJoey:  I\\'ll show you how.\\nRachel: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your \"special\" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?\\nMonica: Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn\\'t get rid of you for 3 days!\\nRachel: Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?\\nChandler:  She\\'s right, you shouldn\\'t have bought tickets just for us ...\\nMonica: Ahhh!\\nChandler: Let me finish ...\\nMonica: There\\'s the man I married!!\\nRachel: All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it\\'s the last you\\'re gonna hear from us!\\nMonica: Fine! Don\\'t be my friends! I\\'ll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I\\'ll pay for their plastic surgery so they\\'d look just like you!\\nRachel: !\\nJoey: Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I\\'m buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!\\nRoss: Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I\\'m gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you guys! We\\'ve got to keep all the tickets together\\nMonica: No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!\\nJoey: Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!\\nChandler: Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!\\nRachel: Ok, that\\'s it! Just give\\'em to me! I\\'ll split them up!\\nJoey:  Oh!\\nPhoebe:  OOOOOHHHHH!\\nRoss:  Hey, hey!!\\nPhoebe:\\nRachel: Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.\\nJoey: No, no!\\nPhoebe: If we are not doing it together, we\\'re not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .\\nEveryone: NO!!\\nPhoebe: Don\\'t come any closer!\\nChandler: Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...\\nPhoebe: No, what\\'s more important, your friends or money?\\nEveryone but Monica: Friends!\\nMonica: Money!  Friends...\\nPhoebe: Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?\\nMonica: They\\'re all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...\\nRoss: Monica!\\nPhoebe: Ok, good!  I think I broke your bowl.\\nRoss: Go, go, go!!\\nPhoebe: What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.\\nMonica: Phoebe, we lost half of them.\\nPhoebe: So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I  was gonna win, remember?\\nRoss: Weird.. your psychic didn\\'t mention anything about the scary pigeon...\\nPhoebe: As a matter of fact she said that\\'s how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.\\nChandler:  Hey, there\\'s two messages. These could be from work!\\nMonica: Oh, play them!\\nChandler: Ok, here we go!\\nMessage:  \"I sh.. I shouldn\\'t have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady\\'s hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.\"\\nPhoebe: Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.\\nSecond message: \"Hey Chandler, it\\'s Charlie\"\\nChandler: This is..shhh!\\nSecond Message: \"Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I\\'m really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want.\"\\nMonica: Oh God, I am so sorry honey...\\nAll: Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!\\nRachel: Oh, it is so unfair. It\\'s like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.\\nChandler: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?\\nRachel: No, she was just much better at job than me!\\nPhoebe: Guys, the drawing is about to start!\\nRachel:  You know what? We should call my mum\\'s house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.\\nRoss: Oh yeah, it\\'s a good idea!\\nMonica:  Honey, you\\'ve been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.\\nChandler: Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let\\'s go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?\\nMonica:\\nRoss:\\nRachel: Hi mum, put her back on!\\nJoey:  Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.\\nTV: \"Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53\"\\nChandler: I got that!\\nRoss: Oh, we have one too!!\\nMonica: We are on a roll, people!!\\nRoss:  Come on!!\\nRachel:  Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you!

He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!\\nJoey/Drake: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.\\nRachel/actress: It\\'s over! You have to accept that.\\nJoey/Drake: How can I? Knowing I\\'ll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I\\'ll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it\\'s all I can do not to kiss you right now.\\nRachel:  Kiss me.\\nJoey: What?\\nRachel: Kiss me.\\nJoey: Ah, Rach, it doesn\\'t say that!\\nRachel: No, I\\'m saying...\\nJoey: but, but..\\nRachel: just... don\\'t talk...\\nRachel: .

God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!\\nChandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.\\nRoss: Oh, that\\'s not cool.\\nChandlers: Dude, none of this is cool.\\nRoss: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  I wish I\\'d thought this through.\\nChandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel\\'s, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.\\nRoss: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.\\nChandler: Ok, how about this ?\\nRoss: No, no, no, you can\\'t take the remote control!\\nChandler: Yes, but the batteries...\\nChandler: Thank you, thank you very much!\\nRoss: Let\\'s celebrate with some maple candy!\\nChandler: No!\\nRoss: At least tell me where you hid it.\\nRachel: Can I ask you a question?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nRachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?\\nMonica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\\nRachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\\nMonica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\\nRachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know! I mean, maybe that\\'s something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\\nMonica: A love scene? With who?\\nRachel: Olivia.\\nMonica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.\\nRachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?\\nMonica: I don\\'t know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don\\'t have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\\nRachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake\\'s lines in the dream...\\nMonica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I\\'m talking about. I took two psych classes in college.\\nRachel: You took the same class twice.\\nMonica: It was hard!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nRachel and Monica: Hi.\\nPhoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\\nMonica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn\\'t clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I\\'ll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\\nMonica: Phoebe, it\\'s not what you wear. It\\'s sort of your songs... I just don\\'t think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I\\'ll just, I\\'ll take the hat back .\\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\\nPhoebe: My songs aren\\'t good enough for your restaurant?\\nRachel: Ok, we\\'re still on that.\\nMonica: I didn\\'t say your songs were not good enough.\\nPhoebe: Then what\\'s wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\\nMonica: Tiny portions?\\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can\\'t see it, I can\\'t see it\"!\\nMonica: Phoebe, it\\'s not about quantity.\\nPhoebe: Well...it\\'s not about quality.\\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It\\'s what some people sing in.\\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don\\'t taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\\nMonica: Ok, so that\\'s what we\\'re doing. You know, when I\\'m in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I\\'m wearing ear plugs.\\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\\nReceptionist: Here\\'s your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\\nChandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\\nChandler: Oh, I didn\\'t factor in the room tax.\\nRoss: Oh dude, don\\'t worry about it, I found an unattended maid\\'s car. We\\'re way ahead of the game.\\nRoss: Oh my god.\\nChandler: What?\\nRoss: There\\'s something new in the bowl.\\nChandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away.\\nRoss: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!\\nChandler: There\\'s a forest right outside.\\nRoss: It\\'s not the same.\\nChandler: Ok, go quick!\\nRoss:  Thank you for a delightful stay.\\nRoss: Oh, my maple candy!\\nPhoebe:  Food here at \\'Javu\\'..will kill you..the food here at \\'Javu\\' ...will kill you..\\nMonica: Thank god, it\\'s just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.\\nPhoebe: You\\'d better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.\\nMonica: Ok, you have to stop playing now.\\nPhoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!\\nMonica: Oh yeah? Ok, let\\'s settle this, come on!\\nPhoebe:  Get your garlic-peelers off me!\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!\\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .\\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?\\nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .\\nMonica: Excuse us!\\nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend\\'s cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry...\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry too...\\nMonica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I\\'ll whip you up some dinner?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! As long as it\\'s free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...\\nPhoebe:  Who\\'s hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won\\'t hate me?\\nRachel: Hey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?\\nJoey:  Oh man! I thought I got it all!\\nRachel:  How...how...?\\nJoey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?\\nRachel: uh-huh\\nJoey: And I couldn\\'t find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!\\nRachel:  Wow...definitely just Drake...\\nJoey: What?\\nRachel: What...how is it going with Drake?\\nJoey: Oh...I don\\'t think it\\'s going very well...\\nRachel: What...that scene I saw was so good!\\nJoey: Well, I\\'m feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...\\nRachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you\\'re bad so I\\'ll give you a compliment?\\nJoey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I\\'m in love with Olivia.\\nRachel: So?\\nJoey: So...I\\'ve never played that!\\nRachel: Ooh! Honey, it can\\'t be that hard, I mean, you\\'ve been in love before?\\nJoey: Uh...well...just once...with you...\\nRachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I\\'m just going to blow past it... well can\\'t you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\\nJoey:  What the hell are you talking about??\\nRachel:  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you\\'re playing the scene.\\nJoey:  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there\\'s this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can\\'t... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn\\'t know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\\nRachel:  Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\\nJoey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There\\'s a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia\\'s bedroom, and she doesn\\'t know he\\'s there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn\\'t be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\\nJoey:\\nClosing credits\\nChandler: I got you something from Vermont!\\nMonica:  That\\'s weird...it\\'s empty!\\nRoss:  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?\\n======== 09-20\\nTeleplay: Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen  Story: Shana Goldberg-Meehan  Directed by: Sheldon Epps  Transcribed by: Eleonora, Pheeboh, Sebastiano & Vanessa\\nJoey:  Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?\\nChandler:  Well, let me see...

And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?\\nJoey:  I can\\'t believe you guys went for that one!\\nRachel: Joey, why wouldn\\'t you invite us to your parties?\\nJoey: You\\'re fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!\\nRachel: Well, then so you just invite me...!\\nJoey:  Please, I was trying to be nice, you\\'re the worst one!\\nRachel: Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...\\nJoey: Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don\\'t tell anybody else. It\\'s up on the roof at 8.\\nRachel:  And it\\'s out of my system!\\nProfessor Spafford:  And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn\\'t believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It\\'s a pity I\\'m allergic to shellfish.\\nRoss:  So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?\\nProfessor Spafford: And that\\'s not all I\\'m allergic to.\\nRoss:  Oh, it\\'s not over!\\nProfessor Spafford: I\\'m also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...\\nRoss: So basically all nuts?\\nProfessor Spafford: Interestingly... no.\\nCharlie: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word \"interesting\".\\nProfessor Spafford: If you\\'ll excuse me I\\'m going to use the restroom.\\nCharlie: Oh my God!!\\nRoss: I\\'ve lost the will to live.\\nCharlie: Let\\'s ditch him!\\nRoss: What?\\nCharlie: Come on, he\\'s still in the bathroom! I\\'m begging you!\\nRoss: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm...  When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...\\nCharlie: Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let\\'s go!!\\nRoss:  Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.\\nPhoebe: Hi!\\nRoss: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you\\'re a paleonthologist, too!  Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion\\'s new theory of species\\' variegation in segmented arthopods?\\nCharlie: Well, I think he\\'s a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...\\nPhoebe: Ah, ah.\\nCharlie:\\nRoss:  Ranion\\'s theory of species variegation?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!\\nMonica:  So, did you two have fun?\\nRoss: Oh my God, she\\'s great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she\\'s just cool, and funny...\\nMonica: And I don\\'t know if you\\'ve noticed but she\\'s a  HI!\\nRachel:  Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I\\'m not feeling really well. I think I can\\'t get out for the play.\\nRoss: Really? Wh-what\\'s wrong?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know! I think it\\'s kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!\\nCharlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.\\nRachel: ... Ok, who is this?\\nRoss: I\\'m sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she\\'s a collegue.\\nRachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I\\'m sure you don\\'t want to get my chicken disease!\\nMonica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?\\nRachel: Sure!  Oh...\\nMonica: You\\'re not sick!\\nRachel: What? Yes, I am!\\nMonica: Ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??\\nRachel: When you\\'re sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!\\nMonica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!\\nRachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!\\nMonica: Ok, what is this?\\nRachel: Ok!  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!\\nMonica:  WHAT?\\nRoss:  Wh-what\\'s going on?\\nMonica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!\\nRachel: And he didn\\'t want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!\\nCharlie: I thought you came to say you were sick.\\nRachel: Ok professor or detective?\\nPhoebe: Joey\\'s having a party and he wasn\\'t gonna invite us?\\nRachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That\\'s why he\\'s sending you to that play! That\\'s why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!\\nPhoebe: And that horrible museum tour!\\nRoss: No, I arranged that...\\nJoey:  Hey you guys, I\\'m turning in. Have fun.\\nPhoebe: We know about your party Joey.\\nJoey: What party?\\nMonica: The game\\'s over! Take off your robe!\\nJoey:  Ok... I mean...\\nEveryone: No!! Cover it up!!\\nJoey:\\nJoey:  Thanks for coming.\\nMonica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!\\nKyle Lowder:\\nMonica:  I love you!\\nJoey: Hey, that\\'s why I didn\\'t invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...\\nMonica: Oh yeah that\\'s what you want - my inhibitions lowered.\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica:  Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.\\nPhoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?\\nMonica:  Oh my God! Chandler!\\nChandler: Where the hell is everybody?\\nBitter lady:  Why don\\'t you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.\\nMonica:  Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she\\'s gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this \"best wishes\" crap. I want \"love\".\\nRachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.\\nMonica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!\\nMatthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel.\\nRachel: Nice to meet you.\\nMatthew Ashford: Call me.\\nRachel: Ok\\nMonica:  We will!!\\nMonica:  Look at you with all the guys!\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nMonica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?\\nRachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you\\'ve forgotten about Chandler!\\nMonica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life...\\nRoss:  So, eh... it\\'s probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?\\nCharlie: Actually, I\\'m kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.\\nRoss: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can\\'t be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?\\nCharlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.\\nRoss: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?\\nCharlie: Yeah...\\nRoss: ... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that\\'s like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...\\nCharlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.\\nRoss: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!\\nCharlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...\\nRoss:  Oh I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t mean to pry... it\\'s just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch \"Access Hollywood\".\\nCharlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.\\nRoss: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?\\nCharlie: A guy who won two.\\nRoss:  Two? Wha...? Don\\'t tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart\\nCharlie: Yeah... for three years.\\nRoss: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn\\'t won the Nobel Prize?\\nCharlie: ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.\\nRoss: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?\\nCharlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.\\nRoss: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?\\nPhoebe: Hey Ross!\\nRache: How is it going with Charlie?\\nRoss:  Oh Great! After I finish my wine I\\'m going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.\\nPhoebe: Oh, What\\'s the matter?\\nRoss: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.\\nRachel: I always loved that!!\\nRoss: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can\\'t compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Worse?\\nRoss: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  Oh, you... you like that?\\nPhoebe:\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Come on! I think this is funny!\\nBitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin\\' \"Now would be a really great time for an intermission\", huh?\\nChandler:  oh yes, God yes!!\\nBitter lady:  How could he leave me?!?!\\nChandler: I... I don\\'t know... you seem lovely.\\nJoey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.\\nRoss: Nice to meet you.\\nDirk: Hey! So what show are you on?\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'m no actor, I\\'m a professor of palaeontology.\\nJoey: It\\'s a science.\\nDirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on \"Days\". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.\\nJoey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...\\nRoss: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.\\nDirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.\\nRoss: I\\'d lead with that.\\nMonica: That\\'s it, just sign right on the bra .\\nJoey: Monica!\\nMonica: Don\\'t worry Joe, I won\\'t come next year!\\nJoey:  What have you got there?\\nRoss: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.\\nJoey: Ah, let me see!  Damn, that\\'s a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?\\nRachel:  I think I am.\\nJoey: . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don\\'t feel any different.\\nJoey:  Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...\\nRachel:  Why, why, what\\'s wrong with these guys?\\nJoey: Nothing major, it\\'s just that, you know, they\\'re not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.\\nRachel: Joey, you\\'re so sweet.\\nJoey: That\\'s true. But you know what, it doesn\\'t matter because I already know who you\\'re gonna go home with tonight.\\nRachel: Who ?\\nJoey: Me.\\nRachel:  Really?\\nJoey: Yes, \\'cause we live together, that\\'s a joke!\\nRachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn\\'t get it!\\nJoey: Gotcha.\\nRachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey.\\nChandler:  So, how did you enjoy the play?\\nMonica: Oh my god, honey, I\\'m so so so so so sorry.\\nChandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.\\nMonica: You really liked it?\\nChandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn\\'t I, because as a man I\\'ve been trained  But after chapter 16: \"fat, single and ready to mingle\", I was uplifted.\\nMonica: Oh really!\\nChandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!\\nMonica: No!\\nChandler: Did somebody sign your bra?\\nMonica: So I got it when I was 13...\\nPhoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?\\nRoss: It\\'s actually a 1,000,000$ prize.\\nPhoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she\\'s looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd.\\nRoss: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I\\'ve written were widely discredited.\\nPhoebe: You\\'re so much more than just brains! You\\'re sweet, and kind, and funny...\\nRoss: And sexy.\\nPhoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!\\nRoss: Yeah, you\\'re right, thanks Pheebs, I\\'m gonna go find her.\\nPhoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!\\nRoss: Stop going through my stuff !\\nRachel:  Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nRachel: I just wanted to let you know I\\'ve changed my mind: I\\'m gonna do it, I\\'m gonna kiss Joey.\\nMonica: No, you can\\'t! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.\\nRachel: Please, what about you and Chandler?\\nMonica: That\\'s different! I was drunk and stupid!\\nRachel: Well hello !\\nMonica: What about all the guys that you\\'ve got the phone numbers from? Why don\\'t you just kiss one of them?\\nRachel: I could, I could but I don\\'t want to! I want to kiss Joey!\\nMonica: Alright . I think it\\'s a big mistake but it\\'s your decision.\\nRachel:  I\\'m gonna do it.\\nMonica: And I can\\'t stop you.\\nRachel: No.\\nRoss:  Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?\\nRoss: I\\'m smarter than him!\\nClosing credits\\nPhoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.\\nChandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.\\nMonica: Oh, you\\'re so wonderful.\\nBitter woman: Why don\\'t you like me! Chapter one: my first period.\\nChandler: Can\\'t believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .\\n======== 09-21\\nTeleplay: Robert Carlock   Story: Scott Silveri   Directed by: Gary Halvorson   Transcribed by: Eleonora, Pheeboh, Sebastiano & Vanessa\\nMonica: It\\'s so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?    I thought you\\'d end up kissing Charlie.\\nRoss: Hey, I thought I\\'d end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!\\nChandler: I missed most of the party  Charlie\\'s a girl, right?\\nRoss: Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did    not kiss.\\nRachel: I don\\'t know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls    at the party, GOD!\\nRoss: Why do you care so much?\\nMonica: Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?\\nRachel:  I just... All I\\'m saying    is... I don\\'t think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.\\nRoss: Oh, I don\\'t know, they seem to have a shared interest in each    other\\'s tonsils...\\nPhoebe: Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids    and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey\\'s raw sexual magnetism... Oh,    those nerds will get laaaaaid!\\nRachel: All right, so... Ross, you\\'re ok with all this? I mean...\\nRoss: Yeah, it\\'s no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I\\'m fine with    it...\\n\\nRoss: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nAll: Hi!\\nRoss: I\\'m gonna get some more coffee.\\nCharlie: Oh, you know what? I\\'ll come with you!\\nRoss: Ok.\\nChandler:  So, a professor, uh?\\nJoey: Yeah! She is cool, and she\\'s so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious     That\\'s not    how she used it...?\\nCharlie:  I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don\\'t    ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I\\'m... well, I\\'m kind of embarrassed.    I really hope you don\\'t think less of me.\\nRoss: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don\\'t think less of you. I mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like    someone and don\\'t kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.\\nCharlie: You know, actually I\\'m a little surprised to myself. I mean,    Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they\\'re all professors,    and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you    know, very cerebral...\\nRoss: Yeah, I know the type.\\nJoey: Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we\\'d better get acrimonious.    No? Am I getting close?\\nOpening credits\\nPhoebe:  Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey you guys! Look what I just got.\\nRachel: Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?\\nPhoebe: I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania    Twain.\\nRachel:  Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!\\nPhoebe: Oh... then I overpaid.\\nMonica: Hey, what\\'s this?\\nRachel: Oh, it\\'s a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.\\nMonica: Oh, you can\\'t show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage    chains.\\nRachel: Ah, why, now I can\\'t get a massage? There are so many things    that she disapproves of! I can\\'t eat veal, I can\\'t wear fur, I can\\'t go hunting...\\nMonica: Do you wanna go hunting?\\nRachel: Well, I would like to have the option!!\\nPhoebe:  Hey, Rachel!!\\nRachel: Oh!\\nPhoebe: No, you can\\'t go there! You know how I feel about these \"big    massage places\"! They\\'re putting people like me out of business!\\nMonica: And she wants to go hunting, too!!\\nRachel: Phoebe, come on, I don\\'t wanna waste it! It would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks!\\nPhoebe: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It\\'s about... it\\'s    about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.\\nRachel: I don\\'t care about any of that!!\\nPhoebe: Well, do you care about friendship?\\nRachel: Oh!\\nPhoebe: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don\\'t use    this gift certificate. I\\'m asking you as a friend.\\nRachel: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won\\'t use it!\\nPhoebe: Promise?\\nRachel: I promise.\\nPhoebe: Thank you.\\nRachel: But I am going hunting!!\\nMonica:  Hey honey! I missed you today!\\nChandler: Oh, yeah?\\nMonica: Yeah.  What d\\'you wanna do tonight?\\nChandler: Oh, well... Maybe we could...\\nMonica: Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience!    Besides, tomorrow we\\'re doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.\\nChandler: We really need to take those tests?\\nMonica: Honey, we\\'ve been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think    it\\'s a good idea to find out if everything\\'s ok. Just a few routine tests.\\nChandler: But I don\\'t wanna do it in a cup!\\nMonica: What is the big deal?\\nChandler: It\\'s weird! In a doctor\\'s office?\\nMonica: It\\'s not ok to do it in a doctor\\'s office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?\\nChandler:     And in my defense, it was a Wendy\\'s!\\nMonica: Look, I don\\'t wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it\\'s a good idea!\\nChandler: Yeah, ok. I\\'m sure that doctor\\'s office can\\'t be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey\\'s factory!\\nMonica:  OH!\\nChandler: Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!\\nJoey:  Who says that wine has to cost    more than milk!\\n\\nJoey: Heeey!\\nCharlie: Hi!\\nJoey: Come on in, how are ya?\\nCharlie: I\\'m good!\\nJoey: Can I offer you a drink?\\nCharlie: Please, I\\'ve been crazed all day!

The Mets suck, ok? You wanna    see the Yankees.\\nCharlie: No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!\\nJoey: Which one, they all suck!\\nCharlie: The museum!\\nJoey:  I don\\'t think so.\\nRachel:  Hi there!\\nReceptionist:  Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa    SPA.

Listen, is there someone    who can fill in for me?\\nReceptionist: Sorry, everyone is booked!\\nPhoebe: But that woman can\\'t know I work    here. She\\'s a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are.\\nReceptionist: Then why you work here?\\nPhoebe: \\'Cause it\\'s good money! But that doesn\\'t change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!\\nReceptionist: Well, I think this is a great place to work!\\nPhoebe:  Ok, are they listening?\\n\\nJoey: Ross!\\nRoss: Hi!\\nJoey: I need to talk to you about Charlie.\\nRoss:  Oh, do you, do you really?\\nJoey: Yeah, I\\'m... I\\'m kind of having a little problem.\\nRoss: Look, if you don\\'t know what the word \"acrimonious\"    means, just don\\'t use it!\\nJoey: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She\\'s cool, she\\'s funny, her    body is soo...\\nRoss: Get to the problem!\\nJoey: Yes. It\\'s just that she\\'s so much smarter than all the girls I\\'ve    ever dated! Combined! I don\\'t want her to think I\\'m stupid!\\nRoss:  Are you wearing two belts?\\nJoey:  EH, what do you know!\\nRoss: You were saying you didn\\'t want to seem stupid.\\nJoey: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don\\'t know how to talk about that stuff.

Let\\'s see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!\\nJoey: The Metsss!\\nRoss: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\nJoey:  You know, if they\\'re    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!\\nRoss: Yeah, most of it it\\'s a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!\\nJoey: Ok, all right, so I\\'ll take her to the MET.\\nRoss: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there\\'s this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick\\'s Cathedral and there there\\'s this great little pastry shop that    she\\'d love.\\nJoey: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!\\nRoss: But I\\'m not! . You know what if you\\'re in the mood for    Thai food...\\nJoey: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too    fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?\\nRoss: Ok.\\nJoey: You got to tell me exactly what to do there.\\nRoss: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that\\'s the antiquities    wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.\\nJoey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right\\nChandler: I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.\\nMonica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that.\\nNurse: Mr. Bing?  Here you are! You\\'ll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container.\\nChandler: Deposit my specimen? You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk. Thanks, got it.\\nMonica: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you\\'re going    to be ok?\\nChandler: Yeah, I guess!\\nMonica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares!

How great is this!\\nMonica: Hey, we\\'re probably fertile, let\\'s go home!\\nChandler: Why are you here?\\nJanice: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...\\nChandler:  No no no... I mean, why? why is    she here??\\nJanice: Oh! Someone\\'s a little cranky today cuz    they have to do it in a cup! .\\nChandler: What!?\\n\\nMonica: This was fun! But I\\'ve got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!\\nChandler: I\\'d love to stay, but I have eh...\\nJanice: Please... go!

Put your face in the hole.\\nRachel: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.\\nPhoebe: Okay, then I\\'m Swedish...\\nMonica: So, what\\'s your name?\\nPhoebe: It\\'s a normal Swedish name... Ikea...\\nRachel: Oh... what an interesting name.\\nPhoebe: Ja!\\nRachel: You know I...\\nPhoebe:  Time for your scalp massage!\\nRachel:\\nPhoebe: Is something wrong?\\nRachel: No, it\\'s just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...     Yeah, say hey, you\\'ll know this, what\\'s the capital of Sweden?\\nPhoebe:  Uhm... Stockholm.\\nRachel: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!\\nJoey:  Note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.\\nRoss: Now, do you have any idea what you just said?\\nJoey:  No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!\\nRoss: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.\\nJoey: Phonetically?\\nRoss: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don\\'t have time    for this.\\nJoey: Ok.\\nRoss: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,    I\\'m really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!\\nJoey: Ah! I\\'m an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\"    I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".\\nRoss: Wow. What does that mean?\\nJoey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means \"you\\'re gonna get eaten by a bear\".\\nRoss: Ok! So let\\'s move on to the Renaissance?\\nJoey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it\\'s really bumpy! .\\nRoss: Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can\\'t touch the paintings.\\nJoey: Come on! you...\\nRoss: No!\\nChandler:  Janice! You\\'re not... gone?\\nJanice: Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don\\'t allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?\\nChandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!\\nJanice: That\\'s not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren\\'t you worried about the results?\\nChandler: I haven\\'t... I haven\\'t even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.\\nJanice: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.\\nChandler:  Yeah, but what if it\\'s not? What if there    is a reason why we can\\'t have a baby?\\nJanice: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it\\'s gonna be just fine.\\nChandler:  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can\\'t believe    I didn\\'t even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... \\'that\\'...\\nJanice: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can\\'t do it at a doctor\\'s office?\\nChandler:  It was a \"Wendy\\'s!!    \"\\nPhoebe:\\nRachel: Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have    a friend who is a masseuse.\\nPhoebe: Oh, Ja! Ja!\\nRachel: Yah! She\\'s... uhm... not very good though...\\nPhoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know... maybe it\\'s because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar...\\nPhoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you\\'re    such a high maintenance tight ass!\\nRachel:  Phoebe!!\\nPhoebe: You know it\\'s me?\\nRachel: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!\\nPhoebe: How can you come here?\\nRachel: How could you not tell me you worked here?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t have to tell you everything!\\nRachel: Yes you do, if you\\'re going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage!\\nPhoebe: Tips not included.\\nRachel: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?\\nPhoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...    you pay a price. Now I\\'m this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!    paying taxes!\\nRachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles    and I so admire that! I don\\'t have any!\\nPhoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It\\'s time    I took my life back!\\nRachel: Good for you Pheebs!\\nPhoebe: Ok.\\nPhoebe: Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn\\'t mean any    of that. I love you.\\nRoss: Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!\\n\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nCharlie: Hi!\\nRoss: Hey, how was the Met?\\nCharlie: The museum was amazing!\\nRoss: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?\\nCharlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didn\\'t even make any sense.\\nRoss: What do you mean?\\nCharlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around.\\nRoss:  Wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the Met, did you go to the right?\\nCharlie: No, we went to the left.\\nRoss:  Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together.\\nCharlie: Yeah, it\\'s fun .\\nRoss: What?\\nCharlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don\\'t really    know me that well; it would be weird.\\nRoss: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.\\nCharlie: Well... I\\'m just thinking that maybe he\\'s not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common    with. You know what I mean?\\nRoss:  Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey    a chance. I mean, he\\'s a great guy, and sure he doesn\\'t know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.\\nCharlie: Yeah, I guess that\\'s true.\\nRoss: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You    know, that\\'s the kind of guy Joey is.\\nCharlie: He is very sweet. Plus he\\'s hot!\\nRoss: That was going to be my next argument.\\n\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nCharlie: Hey!\\nJoey:  You\\'re ready?\\nCharlie: Yeah, let\\'s go.  Thanks    Ross.\\nJoey:  Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up.\\nRoss: Glad I could help man.\\nJoey: Although some of that stuff wasn\\'t where you said it was gonna    be, but...  I made it work.\\nChandler:  It is not okay that I\\'m aroused by this now.\\n\\nChandler: Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.\\n\\nMonica: Hey sweetie.\\nChandler: Doctor Connelly just called.\\nMonica: With good news?  \"Doctor Connelly just    called! \" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem    with me or with you?\\nChandler: Actually it\\'s both of us.\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment.\\nMonica: Oh... what does that mean?\\nChandler: It means that my guys won\\'t get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It    means...\\nMonica: Chandler?\\nChandler:  It means that we can keep trying, but there\\'s    a good chance this may never happen for us.\\nMonica:  Oh my God!\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry.\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry too.\\nChandler: Well, we\\'re gonna... we\\'re gonna figure this out.\\nMonica:  I know.\\nClosing credits\\nReceptionist: Good morning Phoebe.\\nPhoebe:  Good morning receptionist.\\nReceptionist: Here\\'s your schedule for the day. Your first client is    in room No. 1.\\nPhoebe: Rachel Green?  Son of a bitch, she came back?\\n\\nPhoebe:  Are you ready for    your Scottish massage?

That feels sooo good!\\nRachel:  Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!\\nCharlie: I\\'m sorry, what?\\nRachel: Oh... Oh, I\\'m sorry! I\\'m not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.\\nCharlie: From... Cosmo??\\nRachel: Yeah, yeah... It\\'s... \"climax your way to better skin\".\\nCharlie:  So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I\\'m soo bad at picking out clothes!\\nJoey: So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.\\nRachel:  Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!\\nJoey: Oh hey Rach!\\nRachel: Yeah...\\nJoey: Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.\\nRachel: Oh, well...\\nCharlie: I\\'m sure you have better things to do.\\nJoey: Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she\\'s the one who taught me, you don\\'t wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you\\'re trying on clothes.\\nCharlie: If you have the time, I\\'d really appreciate the help.\\nRachel: Ok, uh-uh... Let\\'s-Let\\'s shop!!\\nJoey: ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!\\nPhoebe:  That\\'s off, right?\\nJoey: What\\'s the matter, Pheebs?\\nPhoebe: Oh... Mike\\'s sister just invited me to a party tonight, he\\'s gonna be there. And she was like \"Oh, don\\'t worry! I asked him. He\\'s totally ok with seeing you!\". So now I have to go so he\\'ll think that I\\'m totally ok with seeing him!\\nRachel: Which you\\'re not, because you\\'ve totally hung up on him!\\nPhoebe: Exactly!\\nRachel: And you\\'re gonna want him to eat his heart out so you\\'re gonna have to look fabulous!\\nPhoebe:  Aaargh, sexual politics!!\\nRachel: Hey Pheebs, I\\'m-I\\'m taking Charlie shopping, why don\\'t you come and I\\'ll help you find something.\\nPhoebe: Ok, that\\'ll be great!\\nJoey: Oh, ain\\'t that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.\\nRachel: That\\'s not what we\\'re gonna do!\\nJoey: Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin\\'?\\nOpening credits\\nChandler:  Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!\\nMonica: Oh, I so can\\'t believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!\\nChandler: Oh, I can\\'t believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!\\nDoctor Connelly:  Hi there.\\nChandler: Hi.\\nMonica: Hi.\\nDoctor Connelly: I\\'m sorry there wasn\\'t better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.\\nMonica: Ok.\\nDoctor Connelly: Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren\\'t great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.\\nChandler: Oh, DAMN IT!\\nMonica: Don\\'t worry, after a while he\\'ll tune it out.\\nDoctor Connelly: Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.\\nMonica:  Ok.\\nDoctor Connelly: And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.\\nChandler: Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don\\'t think we\\'d want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!\\nRachel: Hi! Ok, you\\'re ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?\\nCharlie: Oh, yeah! Let\\'s do it!\\nJoey:\\nRachel: Not gonna find any clothes in there!\\nRoss:  Hey, you guys!\\nRachel: Hi.\\nRoss: Guess who\\'s up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?\\nCharlie: Umh... Kurts Baley?\\nRoss: Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?\\nJoey: Just... seeing what it\\'d be like to be a paleontologist... it\\'s fun, yeah!\\nCharlie: So you\\'re up for keynote speaker! Who\\'s making the decisions?\\nRoss: Professor Sherman, yeah. I\\'ve a meeting with him today.\\nCharlie: He\\'s a pretty tough guy to impress.\\nRoss: Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.\\nRachel: Oh... you\\'re not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?\\nRoss: Tsz... NO! .\\nChandler:  Hey guys!\\nRoss: Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I\\'d love for you guys to come and hear me.\\nChandler: I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.\\nRoss: It\\'s in Barbados.\\nChandler: But you come first!\\nRachel: I\\'m there!\\nCharlie: We\\'ll see you, guys!\\nJoey: Bye.\\nRachel: Bye, see ya.\\nChandler:  Ok.\\nJoey: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?\\nChandler: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you\\'re giving a sperm sample.\\nRoss: So-so what did the doctor say?\\nChandler: Well... there\\'s surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.\\nJoey: So you\\'re ruling out surrogacy?\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nJoey: So, I don\\'t have to learn what that means?\\nChandler: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we\\'re talking about sperm donors.\\nJoey: Enough said, I\\'m there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?\\nChandler:  ah-ha!\\nRoss: How do you feel about all this?\\nChandler: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don\\'t think there is one.\\nJoey: Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!\\nRoss:  What?\\nRoss:  What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!\\nRoss: The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.\\nProfessor Sherman: Mmm-mm.\\nRoss:  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!\\nRoss: Oh, that\\'s not what you want...\\nShop assistant:  Incentive For Men?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'ll take some of that.\\nRachel: Pheebs, that\\'s for men!\\nPhoebe: No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I\\'m gonna smell like another guy.  Yeah.\\nPhoebe: Ok. Oh good, I\\'m dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!\\nCharlie:  So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?\\nRachel: On Melanie Griffith in \"Working girl\". I think what you want is over here.\\nCharlie: See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a \"thank you\", I would really love to take you out.\\nRachel: Really?\\nCharlie: Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?\\nRachel: Oh, I can\\'t. Because I-I\\'ve seen them.\\nCharlie: You\\'ve seen all the movies...\\nRachel: Yeah! I\\'m a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!\\nPhoebe:  Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?\\nRachel: Sure!\\nPhoebe: Ok!\\nCharlie: Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!\\nRachel: You know that depends on what it is! I\\'ve done a lot of stuff.\\nPhoebe: So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?\\nRachel: She\\'s ok, I just don\\'t get a really good vibe from her!\\nPhoebe: Why?\\nRachel: I don\\'t know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!\\nPhoebe: Who else?\\nRachel: Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica\\'s mom...\\nPhoebe: You like Joey?\\nRachel: Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.\\nPhoebe:  Oh my God!\\nRachel: It\\'s just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It\\'s just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!\\nPhoebe: Uh, wow! Isn\\'t it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?\\nRachel:  Oh, I get it!\\nPhoebe: Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can\\'t do anything about it, he\\'s already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn\\'t be right.\\nRachel: I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nRachel: So can we keep this between us?\\nPhoebe: Sure!\\nRachel: Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!\\nPhoebe: Oh.\\nPhoebe: Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?\\nMonica: Hi honey!\\nChandler: Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!\\nMonica: Oh, of course, it\\'s so nice to see you again, Zack!\\nZack:  You too.\\nChandler: You guys haven\\'t actually met before, but, boy! You\\'re both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I\\'ll get you a beer.\\nMonica: I got it.\\nZack: Thanks.\\nChandler:  So, Zack\\'s pretty nice, uh?\\nMonica: Yeah, I guess.\\nChandler: So, how would you like to have a baby that\\'s half yours and half his!\\nMonica:  Excuse me?\\nChandler: Well, we\\'re talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he\\'s intelligent, he\\'s healthy, he\\'s athletic, I mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!\\nMonica: Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! \"Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm\"!\\nChandler: No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.\\nMonica: Chandler!\\nChandler: I\\'m telling you, he\\'s great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I\\'d think he\\'d be the way to go!\\nMonica: I\\'m not going to be a part of this! You can\\'t just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!\\nChandler: Ok!\\nMonica: Uh!\\nChandler:  Zack!\\nZack: Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don\\'t wanna make a ring.\\nMonica: Tell me about yourself, Zack!\\nRachel: Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!\\nPhoebe: Well, maybe she didn\\'t hear! Ok I\\'m gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I\\'ll talk and see if you can hear me.\\nRachel: Ok, great!\\nRachel: Oh, thank God I can\\'t hear a word that you\\'re saying!\\nPhoebe:  I didn\\'t say anything yet!\\nRachel:  Well, get back in there and talk!\\nPhoebe:  I\\'m Rachel. It\\'s so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.\\nRachel:  What!?\\nPhoebe:  Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.\\nRachel: Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!\\nPhoebe: Ooh! We have a problem.\\nRachel: Oh! What are we gonna do?\\nStranger: Just be honest with her.\\nRachel: Oh my God!\\nStranger: And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...\\nRachel:  Alright! Enough out of you!\\nJoey: Hello?\\nRoss: Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?\\nJoey: No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What\\'s up?\\nRoss: I\\'m meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...\\nJoey: Oh! How\\'s it going?\\nRoss: It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!\\nJoey: What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!\\nRoss: Barbados.\\nJoey: Fine, I\\'ll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!\\nRoss: What am I supposed to do? He\\'s out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.\\nJoey: Well, just wake him up!\\nRoss: I can\\'t! If he realizes that I\\'m the one that put him to sleep, I won\\'t get the job!\\nJoey: Uh! That\\'s a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?\\nMonica: Hey guys! Dinner\\'s ready!\\nZack: Oh! I\\'m gonna go wash up first.  Thanks!\\nChandler: So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!\\nMonica: Ok, there\\'s enthusiastic and there\\'s just plain gay!!\\nChandler: You don\\'t like him.\\nMonica: I think he is fine! It\\'s just that we don\\'t know anything real about him... we should get more information.\\nChandler: Alright! Just follow my lead!\\nZack: You guys have such a great place here.\\nChandler: Oh! Thanks, I\\'m crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?\\nZack: Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for  Dukakis.\\nChandler:  That\\'s really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.\\nZack:  Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.\\nMonica: Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I\\'ve got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?\\nZack:  No...\\nMonica: Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?\\nZack: You guys don\\'t have people for dinner a lot, huh?\\nMonica: We\\'re just making conversation.\\nZack: Ok. I heard a joke today. It\\'s pretty funny...\\nChandler: You know what\\'s not funny? Male Pattern Baldness\\nZack: Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I\\'m flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?\\nMonica & Chandler: Sure! Alright...\\nZack: Ravioli\\'s delicious!\\nChandler: I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?\\nZack: No I didn\\'t.\\nMonica: Yess!!\\nChandler:  We\\'re teeth people Zack!\\nRachel: Alright! Let\\'s just do it. Let\\'s just go over there and see if she heard.\\nPhoebe: Good plan.\\nRachel: Ok.  Wha...? where? Where are you going?\\nPhoebe: Oh! I\\'m sorry Rachel, I don\\'t have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at \"who\\'s more over who\"!\\nRachel:  Hey, hi! Hey, where\\'ve you been?\\nCharlie: Oh! trying on clothes.\\nRachel:  Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that\\'s so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it\\'s just such a small world!\\nCharlie:  Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.\\nRachel: Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.\\nCharlie: No! There\\'s nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.\\nRachel:  Yeah.\\nCharlie: It\\'s just that... I don\\'t understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?\\nRachel: Yeah! That\\'s Phoebe. That\\'s Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It\\'s like she\\'s a nympho!\\nCharlie: Wow!\\nRachel: Yeah...\\nCharlie: You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.\\nRachel:  I try...\\nRoss:\\nProf. Sherman:\\nJoey: ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!\\nPhoebe: Are you sure? Because I\\'m really dreading going to this party.\\nJoey: Then don\\'t go!\\nPhoebe: Mike knows I\\'m coming, and if I don\\'t show up he\\'ll think it\\'s because of him! And I don\\'t want to lose face! That\\'s a very serious thing in my culture.\\nJoey: Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I\\'ll get you good and drunk!\\nPhoebe: You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don\\'t want to go back to the Emergency Room.\\nPhoebe: David?\\nDavid: Phoebe! Hi!\\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\\nDavid: Wow, you look unbelievable.\\nPhoebe: Yeah. What-what are you doing here?\\nDavid: Well, I\\'m back from Minsk... permanently.\\nPhoebe: What happened?\\nDavid: Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nDavid: Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can\\'t be done.\\nPhoebe: Well, it\\'s great that you\\'re back! How are you?\\nDavid: Good, good, life is good...\\nPhoebe: Good!\\nDavid: Ah well, I-I\\'m seeing someone.\\nPhoebe:  Oh, good for you.\\nDavid: She\\'s also a scientist, so she\\'s very smart and pretty and... well, it\\'s actually because of you, really, that we\\'re together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said \"Boy, I want that\".\\nPhoebe: Mike and I broke up.\\nDavid: You\\'re kidding me. Because I\\'m not seeing anybody, I\\'ve just totally made that up.\\nPhoebe: Really?\\nDavid: Yeah, I don\\'t know why, I\\'m sorry, I guess I just didn\\'t want to lose face.\\nPhoebe: I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we\\'re both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That\\'s so not like us!\\nDavid: Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?\\nPhoebe: Well...  no.\\nDavid: Do you wanna get a drink?\\nPhoebe: I\\'d love to.\\nDavid: Great.\\nPhoebe: Ok.\\nDavid: Do you smell beets?\\nPhoebe: Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.\\nCharlie: Hey, there\\'s Phoebe! Is that Mike she\\'s with?\\nRachel: No, that\\'s David.\\nCharlie: There\\'s a third guy?\\nRachel:  Tip of the iceberg.\\nZack: I\\'m gonna take off now. You\\'re gonna let me go home, aren\\'t you?\\nChandler: You sure you don\\'t wanna stick around a little longer?\\nZack: No, no, I should get home, I\\'m kinda tired.\\nChandler: Are you just tired now or are you always tired, \\'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.\\nZack: No it\\'s just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\\nChandler: Ok.\\nChandler: I think we\\'ve found our sperm!\\nMonica: Does seem pretty perfect.\\nChandler: Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?\\nMonica:  No.\\nChandler: Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!\\nMonica: No, that\\'s not it. It\\'s just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don\\'t care if he\\'s the most perfect guy in the world... he\\'s not you.\\nChandler: Yeah, he\\'s better!\\nMonica: No, he\\'s not. And if I can\\'t get pregnant with you, then I don\\'t want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.\\nChandler: Really? Are you sure?\\nMonica: Yeah, I\\'m sure.\\nChandler:  Thank God, because I don\\'t wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I\\'m the husband, I\\'m supposed to... bring the sperm.\\nMonica: That is so sweet. I love you.\\nChandler: So you know this leaves us with...\\nMonica: Adoption.\\nChandler: How do you feel about that?\\nMonica: I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.\\nChandler: Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.\\nMonica: So this is it, we\\'re really gonna adopt?\\nChandler:  Yeah.\\nMonica:  Oh my God, we\\'re gonna be parents!\\nChandler: We are gonna be great parents.\\nMonica: And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.\\nChandler: Wait, if we\\'re lucky, and we\\'re really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!\\nClosing credits\\nChandler: Hey, Zack!\\nZack:  Hey Chandler.\\nChandler: Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.\\nZack: No you didn\\'t.\\nChandler: Really?\\nZack: No you did.\\nChandler: My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We\\'re working on it.\\nJeanette: .\\nZack: Oh, thank you.\\nChandler: You wouldn\\'t know if Jeanette\\'s planning on keeping her baby, would ya?\\nEnd\\n======== 10-01\\nWritten by: Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug\\nMonica: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such   a turn-on.You wanna...?\\nChandler: You know, I\\'d love to, but I\\'m a little tired.\\nMonica: I\\'ll put a pillowcase over my head.\\nChandler: You\\'re on!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica: What\\'s up?\\nPhoebe: Well, okay, Mike\\'s taking a shower, which by the   way there\\'s  no law against.

I didn\\'t even have to ask you   to call me that.\\nMonica: Oh my God, that\\'s Charlie!\\nChandler: She\\'s cheating on Joey with Ross!\\nPhoebe: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...\\nMonica: I\\'m not sure about this.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you\\'re right. This is none of our business.\\nMonica: No I\\'m not sure that it\\'s  the best way to hear   everything. Someone get me a glass!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'m not gonna do this, okay? I\\'m not gonna eavesdrop   on my friend.\\nRachel:  Ooh... I love Barbados!\\nJoey: Ooh... I can\\'t believe I\\'m kissing you. I\\'m     kissing Rachel!\\nRachel: I know, I\\'m her!\\nPhoebe:  Rachel and Joey! It\\'s Rachel and Joey!!!\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: Get over here!\\nRachel: ooh...\\nChandler: Wow!\\nMonica:  Oh my God,   I love how thin these walls are!\\nMonica:  Thank you.\\nOPENING CREDITS\\nRachel: Hey, you know, before you said     that nothing could happen between us? What changed?\\nJoey: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then   I saw him kissing Charlie...\\nRachel: What? Ross and Charlie?  Wow! She\\'s really   making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe this. Rachel and Joey?\\nChandler: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?   No-one is manning that wall!\\nMonica: I\\'m on it!\\nChandler: Anything?\\nMonica: I think I hear curtains closing...\\nPhoebe: We\\'ve got shoes being kicked off over here.\\nMonica: Bedsprings, unmistakable!\\nChandler: You do realise  that\\'s your brother?\\nMonica: Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey   and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We\\'re the only people  leaving with the   same person we came with.\\nChandler: That\\'s not true. I came with Monica and I\\'m leaving   with Weird Al.\\nMonica: Okay, I\\'ve had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,   before we leave, I\\'m going to the salon.\\nChandler: Okay Buckwheat!\\nPhoebe: You gotta hear this, it\\'s great... It\\'s like free   porn!\\nRoss: Weh...*sigh*\\nCharlie: uhm... Is everything okay?\\nRoss: Yeah, It\\'s just... I don\\'t think I can do this...\\nCharlie: Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread,   because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could   just...\\nRoss: No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.   Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he\\'s okay with it.\\nCharlie: I uhm... I completely understand.\\nRoss: Alright, I\\'m gonna go find them...  Okay, I see you later.\\nCharlie: Okay...\\nPhoebe: That\\'s the door. He\\'s gone...\\nChandler: And she\\'s... turning on the TV... and watching...   Miss Congeniality!\\nMonica: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it   too well!\\nRoss: Hey, what are you guys doing?\\nPhoebe: Oh, we\\'re just... we\\'re sad to go so we\\'re just saying   goodbye to the hotel.\\nMonica:\\nChandler:  Bye!\\nRoss: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?\\nChandler: He\\'s probably in his room with his current girlfriend   Charlie. That\\'s the situation as we know it...\\nRoss: Well, if you see him could you please tell   him I\\'m looking for him?\\nChandler: You got it!\\nRoss: Thanks!\\nMonica: Other wall, people! Other wall!\\nRoss:\\nJoey: Oh my God, it\\'s Ross. What are we gonna do?\\nRachel: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he   knows we\\'re just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That\\'s not nonchalant!\\nJoey: No idea what it means.\\nRachel: Oh... okay, just hide!\\nRoss:  Rach?\\nRachel: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!\\nRachel: There\\'s no room under the bed.\\nRoss: Is everything okay?\\nRachel: Yeah...\\nRoss: Hey.\\nRachel: Hi...\\nRoss: You know where Joey is?\\nRachel: ...I really don\\'t...\\nRoss: Can I talk to you for a minute?\\nRachel: Yeah, sure...\\nJoey: I don\\'t believe this... Have you guys been...\\nPhoebe: Shhh... This is the listening side of the   wall.\\nRoss: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,   and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.\\nRachel:  Uh-huh... right... yeah...\\nRoss: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the   day I met her.\\nRachel:  Oh, I know... I know it\\'s been   really hard for you.\\nRoss: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before   you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna   be?\\nRachel:  That is hard to say,   Ross. That is hard to say.\\nRoss: You know, I gotta go find him. He\\'s gotta be here someplace.\\nRachel: You would think!\\nRachel: Joey!\\nJoey: Is he gone?\\nRachel:  How are you doing this?\\nJoey: Pssst...\\nRachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this?   Have you guys been listening this entire time?\\nMonica, Chandler and Phoebe: YE-AH!\\nPhoebe: Now, what is this?\\nRachel: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten   minutes and now we\\'re talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth   grade!\\nPhoebe: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated   this could get? What about Ross?\\nJoey: Well, he\\'s with Charlie now.\\nMonica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything   really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don\\'t you think   he deserves the same from you?\\nJoey:  You\\'re a pain in   my ass, Geller!\\nRachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all   the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...\\nChandler: Okay, well we\\'ll go back in there, but will you   do one thing for us? The people that  care about you?\\nRachel: Sure...\\nChandler: Enunciate!\\nRachel: Get out!\\nRachel: Are they right?\\nJoey: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off   until we talk to Ross.\\nRachel: Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don\\'t have   to do anything tonight.\\nJoey: Yeah, I think that\\'d be best... So, so I\\'m gonna...   I\\'m gonna take off...\\nRachel:  Although...\\nJoey:  I like although!\\nRachel: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven\\'t dated in like...   six years...\\nJoey: Six years? Wow... It\\'s almost as long as highschool...\\nRachel: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.\\nJoey: Absolutely! He\\'s not thinking about you.\\nRachel: No...\\nJoey: I\\'m thinking about you...\\nRachel: Yeah...\\nJoey: Let\\'s forget about Ross...\\nRachel: Forgotten.\\nJoey: What\\'s wrong?\\nRachel: Nothing...\\nJoey\\'s voice, but she sees Ross: Seriously... What is it?\\nRachel: Nothing... It\\'s really... It\\'s nothing... Come here,   come here...\\nJoey\\'s voice/Ross: What\\'s wrong?\\nRachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can\\'t seem to get Ross out   of my head...\\nJoey: Well, maybe I can help.\\nRachel/Ross: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do   that again...\\nJoey: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...\\nBoth: Yeah\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nRoss: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nRoss: You guys ready to go?\\nChandler: Not quite. Monica\\'s still at the salon, and I\\'m   just finishing packing.\\nRoss: Dude! You\\'re not taking your Bible?\\nChandler: You\\'re not supposed to take that. Besides, it\\'s   a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?\\nRoss: Learn about Jesus...\\nRoss: Hey!\\nCharlie: So, did you talk to Joey?\\nRoss: Uh, no... no. I couldn\\'t find him. I\\'m just gonna talk   to him on the plane.\\nCharlie: Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!\\nRoss: Stop it!\\nCharlie: PHD\\nRoss: You\\'re filthy!\\nPhoebe: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?\\nRoss: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...\\nMonica: Check it out!\\nPhoebe: Who\\'s day just got better? CHANDLER!\\nChandler: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!\\nMonica: What do you think?\\nChandler: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.\\nMonica: Don\\'t you just love it?\\nRoss: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.\\nCharlie: It\\'s so... something... You go girlfriend!\\nRoss: You\\'ve never said that in your life, have you?\\nCharlie: Not once.\\nRoss: I thought so.\\nMonica: And listen to this...\\nChandler: What d\\'ya know... It\\'s a treat for the eyes and the   ears.\\nJoey: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it\\'s uhm... kinda weird that I\\'m sitting   next to Charlie after we broke up.\\nChandler: Yeah, it\\'s almost if Air Barbados doesn\\'t care   about your social life.\\nJoey: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?\\nRoss: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference   with Charlie.\\nJoey: I understand...\\nRoss: No, I\\'ll do it.\\nChandler: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don\\'t   wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.\\nPhoebe: Uhm... You know, once we\\'re in the air and the captain   turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...\\nMike: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,   \\'cause items may shift during...\\nPhoebe: Aaah... you\\'re not good at this...\\nMike: You don\\'t have to go home tonight, do you?\\nPhoebe: No, I think I can come over. It\\'s Saturday, right?\\nMike: Oh...\\nPhoebe: What?\\nMike: Uhm... I can\\'t do anything tonight.\\nPhoebe: Why not?\\nMike: I have a date.\\nPhoebe: You have a... You have a date? With who?\\nMike: Oh, it\\'s... my girlfriend.\\nPhoebe:  You have...  have a girlfriend?\\nMike: Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started   seeing someone.\\nPhoebe: For how long?\\nMike: Three months.\\nPhoebe: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my   business, but uhm, how long do you think you\\'re gonna keep seeing her?\\nMike: I\\'ll tell her that it\\'s over tonight at dinner. I   promise.\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you   get home, maybe there\\'ll be a special delivery package waiting for you.\\nMike: Maybe I\\'ll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the   packing material...\\nPhoebe: You know what, we\\'re gonna have sex. Let\\'s just leave   it there.\\nRoss: Right, I\\'m gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the   right time. He\\'s always in a good mood after the flight attendant says \"duty   free\".\\nCharlie: Okay... Good luck.\\nRachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really   good time to talk to him.\\nJoey: I guess so. I\\'m just... really nervous.\\nRachel: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you\\'re done,   they\\'ll probably be serving dinner.\\nJoey: Ooh...\\nRachel: Still nervous?\\nJoey: I\\'m gonna get the lasagna.\\nRoss: Hey Rach...\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nRoss: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?\\nRachel: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRoss: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.\\nJoey: Yeah?\\nRoss: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry   to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,   well...\\nJoey: You kissed.\\nRoss: Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?\\nJoey: I saw you.\\nRoss: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else   happened, okay.\\nJoey: Ross, Ross, Ross... It\\'s okay.\\nRoss: What?\\nJoey: It\\'s okay. You know, I totally understand,   alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And...   I want you to be happy.\\nRoss: Are you serious?\\nJoey: Yeah... Now I have something...\\nRoss: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put   my happiness first like that. I mean, you\\'re an incredible friend, you know   that?\\nJoey: Oh... uh...  look... before you...\\nRoss: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,   and generous...\\nJoey: I am those things, yeah.\\nRoss: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always   think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some   stuff...\\nJoey: Dude!\\nRoss: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...\\nJoey: I can\\'t think of anything.\\nRoss: Thanks!\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nRachel: So hi!\\nRoss: Hi!\\nRachel: So you eh, you talked to Joey?\\nRoss: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.\\nRachel: Oh! That\\'s great!\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nRachel: Oh, so everything\\'s okay?\\nRoss: Oh, no, it\\'s great. It\\'s great. He is... He is an amazing   guy.\\nRachel: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.\\nRoss: Well, I\\'m so excited about this.\\nRachel: Really? Excited?\\nRoss: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams   about this...\\nRachel: Excuse me!  You didn\\'t tell him, did you?\\nJoey: I couldn\\'t. He was saying all these really nice things   about me. I didn\\'t want him to get mad and take \\'em all back. I\\'m on a edge   on Chandler.\\nRachel: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget   it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.\\nJoey: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nPhoebe: Hi, Mike\\'s place.\\nMike: Hey, it\\'s Mike.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, that was fast.\\nMike: Oh, err... no, she\\'s not here yet. You know, I think   I\\'m just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you can\\'t do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap   on a pair.Why don\\'t you just tell her that we got back together. You know,   women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.   Just F.Y.I.\\nMike: One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious   on my coffee table.\\nPhoebe: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you   pick her up at the pound?\\nMike: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.\\nPhoebe: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch   her tummy and give her a liver snout.\\nPrecious: Hi, I\\'m Precious, who are you?\\nPhoebe:  I... I\\'m Phoebe.\\nPrecious: Phoebe? Mike\\'s ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of   his life? That Phoebe?\\nPhoebe: Enchant\\nMonica: Oh, I can\\'t wait for everyone at work to see these...    Ow!\\nChandler: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?\\nMonica: Yeah!\\nChandler: So if you want people to see them, then by definition   you\\'re not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?\\nMonica: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn\\'t be   able to do this.\\nChandler: What are you singing?\\nMonica: It\\'s \"Bolero\" from \"10\".\\nChandler: It\\'s \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from \"Apocalypse   Now\"...   See, here\\'s the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy   hair problem. And now that we\\'re home, we don\\'t have that problem anymore,   so if you think about it... I hate them!\\nMonica: You what? You said you liked them.\\nChandler: Did I? Let\\'s refresh. I believe what I said was   that I could see your scalp.\\nMonica: Fine, so you don\\'t like them. Everybody else does.\\nChandler: Again, let\\'s journey back... As I recall what Rachel   said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...   Well, Joey didn\\'t realise that there was anything different.\\nMonica: You know what? I don\\'t care. I like it like this,   and I\\'m gonna keep it. You\\'re just jealous because your hair can\\'t do this...    OUCH!\\nChandler: Hit yourself in the tooth?\\nMonica: And the eye!\\nRoss:\\nRachel: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like   5 milligrams.\\nRoss: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?   Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.\\nRachel: Aaah... Ross, actually there\\'s something that I really   need to talk to you about.\\nRoss:  Okay, shoot!\\nRachel: Okay, uhm... alright, here\\'s the deal.\\nRoss:  OH NO!\\nRachel: What? What is it?\\nRoss: Oh, major shampoo explosion!\\nRachel: Uh, look Ross, this really isn\\'t easy.\\nRoss: Oh, it\\'s all over everything. Why?   Why me?\\nRachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?\\nRoss: I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. You were saying?\\nRachel: Well, yeah... Okay, look it\\'s about me and...\\nRoss: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.   It\\'s even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?\\nRachel: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.\\nRoss: Duh, you think?\\nPhoebe: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike\\'s on his way over. See,   you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at   the restaurant, so you know... Doesn\\'t really matter who\\'s right or wrong.   Point is... I\\'m gonna take off.\\nPrecious: I\\'m not letting you leave until you tell me what\\'s   going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?\\nPhoebe: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?\\nPrecious: My name is Precious.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I can\\'t say that. uhm... Susie, I\\'m gonna be   straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately   that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he\\'s very sorry about   that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.\\nPrecious: I just can\\'t believe this... Why?\\nPhoebe: Well, I don\\'t...\\nPrecious: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what\\'s wrong   with me?\\nPhoebe: Nothing, there\\'s nothing wrong with you.\\nPrecious: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?\\nPhoebe: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have     some pride, for the love of God.\\nPhoebe: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.\\nPrecious: I just can\\'t believe that Mike didn\\'t give me any   warning.\\nPhoebe: But he didn\\'t really know, you know. He wasn\\'t planning   on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...\\nPrecious: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday  ever.\\nPhoebe: Look, Precious... Mike\\'s not worth this.   You\\'re an attractive, intelligent woman and let\\'s face it, Mike\\'s kind of a   wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna   break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don\\'t like to kiss-and-tell,   but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.\\nPrecious: Oh, my God, maybe you\\'re right. Maybe I don\\'t need   him. I deserve to be treated with respect.\\nPrecious: Screw you, Mike. You\\'re a coward and a bastard,   and I hope you rot in hell.\\nPhoebe: You\\'re welcome!\\nChandler: Honey, you\\'ve been in there for a long time...   Is everything okay?\\nMonica: Not really.\\nMonica: I have a problem.\\nChandler: Really? What happened?\\nMonica: Well, I was dancing around, and singing \"No Woman,   No Cry\" and I got stuck.\\nChandler: You can\\'t move at all?\\nMonica: Oh, well, I can move...\\nChandler: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?\\nMonica:  I guess so...\\nChandler:  Some of these look a little   frayed.\\nMonica: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nJoey: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?\\nRachel: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related   emergency. So I guess now it\\'s your turn again.\\nJoey: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it\\'s better   if you tell him, you know. It\\'s easier for a woman. That way, you know, if   he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn\\'t mean it. I\\'m so so--ooory.\\nRachel: Yeah, \\'cause that\\'s what we do.\\nJoey: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How \\'bout this, how   about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we\\'ll both go and we\\'ll tell him together.\\nRachel: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again   we can\\'t...\\nJoey: I know, I know..., but that\\'s okay. I mean, we can   control ourselves, we\\'re not animals.\\nRachel: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that   means good night then?\\nJoey: Yeah! Good night!\\nRachel: Goo--ood night!\\nJoey: Good night!\\nRachel: Seriously, good night!\\nJoey: Stop saying good night.\\nRachel: Okay.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nMonica: Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I\\'d never wear this...\\nChandler: Now that I untangled you, how \\'bout you doing a   little something for me?\\nMonica: Sure, what do you have in mind?\\nChandler: I think you know.\\nMonica: Really? I don\\'t really feel like it.\\nChandler: This is what I want to do.\\nMonica: Okay, I just don\\'t get why you like it so much.\\nChandler:  She\\'s an   FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-02\\nWritten by: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Plummer   Directed by: Ben Weiss   Transcribed by: Kreidy\\nJoey: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn\\'t expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?\\nRachel: We weren\\'t doing anything!\\nJoey: Rach, he just saw us.\\nRachel: Shhh.\\nJoey: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.\\nRachel: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.\\nJoey  Okay, we also kissed in  Barbados, but we didn\\'t plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.\\nRachel: Yeah, you started it! I\\'ve got to chill.\\nJoey: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..\\nRachel: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.\\nJoey: Yeah, but it did happen, so...\\nJoey: Ross?\\nRachel: Ross?  Can we just close the door?\\n   OPENING CREDITS\\n\\nRachel: Ross, say something. Anything.\\nRoss: So you two are..?\\nJoey and Rachel: Yeah.\\nRoss: And have you .. ed?\\nJoey: No, no, no!\\nRachel: No, no, no!\\nRoss: But if I hadn\\'t walked in here, would you..?\\nJoey: Probably.\\nJoey: No, no!\\nRachel: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  You have every right to go nuts.\\nRoss: I\\'m not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?\\nRachel: No, but you know what I mean.\\nRoss: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I\\'m happy for you.   I\\'m fine!\\nJoey: Really?\\nRoss: Absolutely.  But now that I\\'ve had time to absorb it; Lovin\\' this.\\nJoey: Ross..\\nRoss: It\\'s all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what   we should do?\\nRachel: Calm ourselves?\\nRoss: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we\\'ll do it tomorrow night.   I\\'ll cook!!\\nJoey: Look, don\\'t you think that will be a little weird?\\nRoss: Weird? What? What\\'s weird? The only thing weird would be if   someone didn\\'t like Mexican food, because I\\'m making fajitas!!\\nJoey: I do like fajitas.\\n\\nMonica: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There\\'s   inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways   to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.\\nChandler: There\\'s a hair in my coffee.\\nPhoebe: Hey guys!\\nMonica: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., \\'cause he\\'s meeting me here with   the triplets.\\nChandler: You know, it\\'s funny. Every time you say \"triplets,\" I   immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.\\nMonica: That\\'s sweet. Drink your hair.\\nPhoebe: Hey, what\\'s all this stuff?\\nMonica: Oh, they\\'re brochures from different adoption agencies.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!\\nMonica: That\\'s not really how it works.\\nPhoebe: Oh, how does it work?\\nMonica: I don\\'t know!\\nPhoebe: Well, if you\\'re having a hard time, you should talk to my   friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I\\'m sure they\\'d help   you.\\nMonica: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn\\'t that be   great?\\nFrank Jr.: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about.   When we\\'re in a public place, there are certain rules.\\nFrank Jr.: That\\'s not what we talked about!!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nFrank Jr.: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Good to see you.\\nFrank Jr.: Good to see you, too.\\nMonica: Hi Frank.\\nFrank Jr.: Hi, how you doin\\'?\\nMonica: Oh, my goodness, they\\'ve all gotten so big!\\nMonica: Which one is which again?\\nFrank Jr.: Oh, that\\'s Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the   lady\\'s purse. And that\\'s Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that\\'s   Leslie throwing bagels at him.\\nMonica : \"Willing to adopt triplets?\" No!\\n\\nJoey: Ah, can I just say I know we\\'re doing this for Ross, and that\\'s   cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we\\'d be doing on our   first date.\\nRachel: Well, what would we be doing?\\nJoey: I\\'d take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy   dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...\\nRachel: Feel me up?\\nJoey: In a carriage!\\nJoey: Hey, Charlie!\\nRachel: Hey.\\nCharlie: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?\\nRachel: Oh, you bet.\\nJoey: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?\\nCharlie: Actually.. It\\'s stuff you left at my apartment.\\nJoey: Oh. Oh, thanks.\\nCharlie: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you   want.\\nJoey: Yeah, I didn\\'t throw any of that out..\\nRoss: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Come, please come in. Come in.\\nRachel: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.\\nRoss: Oh! That is so thoughtful.\\nJoey: Uh, actually, that\\'s..\\nRoss: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these   things!!\\nCharlie: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...\\nRoss: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren\\'t you? Aren\\'t you? Aren\\'t you?   You see? Who else is fine?\\nJoey: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don\\'t you try to relax, okay? Maybe   have a drink.\\nRoss: You know what? That is a very good idea. I\\'m gonna go make a   pitcher of Margaritas.\\n\\nPhoebe: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.\\nFrank Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, \\'cause before you   know it, they\\'re gonna be awake again.\\nPhoebe: Well, they may be a handful, but they\\'re so cute.\\nFrank Jr.: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest   thing..\\nFrank Jr.: I haven\\'t slept in four years!\\nPhoebe: That\\'s a, that\\'s a long time.\\nFrank Jr.: You just don\\'t know how hard it is, Phoebe. There\\'s just so   many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two\\'s great. You just hold   one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with   his bike helmet on. I\\'ve got no more hands to protect my area! There\\'s   three of them, Phoebe, three!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out   of my area.\\nFrank Jr.: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can\\'t say it,   it\\'s too horrible. No.\\nPhoebe: What?\\nFrank Jr.: No, I can\\'t.\\nPhoebe: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I   didn\\'t have those triplets so you could just run out on them!\\nFrank Jr.: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking   that, you know, maybe you could take one.\\nPhoebe: What?! You can\\'t separate them! That\\'s terrible. Which one?\\n\\nMonica: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great   things about you guys.\\nColleen: Oh, please, we\\'re happy to help.\\nBill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.\\nChandler: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this   room, huh?\\nChandler: I mean, you have a lovely home.\\nMonica: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.\\nColleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.\\nColleen: It\\'s pretty much all the information you need.\\nMonica: Oh my god!\\nColleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then   cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms   in the back.\\nMonica: Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.\\nBill: I know the process is frustrating, but it\\'s so worth it.   Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.\\nChandler: That\\'s great.  Can I see the book?\\nChandler: You want me to wash my hands first, don\\'t you?\\nMonica: It\\'s.. It\\'s just so pretty and white.\\nColleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.\\nColleen: I would have told him to do it too.\\nMonica: Can I adopt you?\\nChandler: Hey, you must be Owen.\\nOwen: Yeah.\\nChandler: I\\'m Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.\\nOwen: You were?\\nChandler: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.\\nOwen: Huh?\\nChandler: You know how to use a compass?\\nOwen: I have a badge in it.\\nChandler: You do? That\\'s fantastic!\\nOwen: You wanna see it?\\nChandler: I\\'d love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your   parents. They\\'re telling us all about how they adopted you.\\nOwen: What?!?\\nChandler: What?\\nOwen: I\\'m adopted?\\nChandler: I got nothing.\\n\\nRoss: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second   batch is gooooood.\\nRachel: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.\\nRoss: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn\\'t it? You know? Just the four of us.   Just hangin\\'.\\nJoey: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?\\nRoss: I\\'m fine! Hey, I\\'m great! I\\'m just.. I\\'m just proud of us.   There\\'s no weirdness, no tension.\\nRachel: No awareness.\\nRoss: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh!   Let\\'s take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?\\nRoss: My fajitas!!\\nRachel: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a   little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he   normally doesn\\'t drink like this.\\nCharlie: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging   alcoholic.\\nCharlie: Oh, I\\'m sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?\\nRoss: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!\\nRachel: Ross, you don\\'t even have oven mitts on!\\nRoss: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!\\n\\nPhoebe: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can\\'t seriously be talking about me   taking one of your kids, can we?\\nFrank Jr.: No, of course we\\'re not.\\nPhoebe: Insane.\\nFrank Jr.: I know.\\nPhoebe: Alice would never go for it, right?\\nFrank Jr.: Oh, I don\\'t know, she\\'s pretty tired, too, I think we\\'ve   got her onboard.\\nPhoebe: Well, just you know, for argument\\'s sake, you know,   hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?\\nFrank Jr.: Huh.\\nPhoebe: Frank Jr.Jr.?\\nFrank Jr.: Oh, you\\'d be getting a really good one. I mean, you know,   he\\'s really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh.\\nFrank Jr.: What\\'s green and says \"hey, I\\'m a frog\"? A talking frog!    Oh, no, you can\\'t have him, he\\'s too funny.\\nPhoebe: Well, alright, that\\'s fine. What about Leslie?\\nFrank Jr.: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she\\'s, she\\'s the only one that   knows how to burp the alphabet.\\nPhoebe: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.\\nFrank Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can\\'t have Chandler, no. No, no. She\\'s my   little genius. I got big hopes for her. She\\'s gonna be a doctor or a   realtor..\\nPhoebe: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.\\nFrank Jr.: Oh, I think you\\'re right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don\\'t think I   can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but   they\\'re my babies.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry, Frank. I didn\\'t realise things were so bad. You   know, I\\'ll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You   name the day, and I\\'ll be there.\\nFrank Jr.: How about tomorrow?\\nPhoebe: Well, that\\'s not good. But you know, I can move some stuff   around, and I\\'ll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day   together.\\nFrank Jr.: You\\'d do that for us?\\nPhoebe: Are you kidding? That\\'s what sisters are for.\\nFrank Jr.  Oh crap, don\\'t   wake up, don\\'t wake up!\\n\\nChandler: Where are Bill and Colleen?\\nMonica: They\\'re in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you   believe how nice they are?\\nChandler: We have to leave!!\\nMonica: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?\\nChandler: I didn\\'t get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,   and he didn\\'t know he was adopted. And there\\'s a slight chance I may   have told him.\\nMonica: Oh my god, where\\'s my purse? No, you know what? I can replace   everything in there. Get that binder, and let\\'s go!\\nColleen: Hey.\\nBill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don\\'t have to eat the   sour worms. Those are for Owen.\\nColleen: I\\'ll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we   haven\\'t told him he\\'s adopted yet.\\nChandler: But kids are so intuitive. Don\\'t you think on some level he   already knows?\\nOwen: I\\'m adopted?!\\nChandler: See? Intuitive!\\nBill: What? Where did you hear that?\\nOwen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.\\nChandler: Which technically now you should give back!\\nColleen: You told him he\\'s adopted?\\nChandler: I\\'m so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or   something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the   door. \"Owen doesn\\'t know he\\'s adopted, and he also thinks that Santa   is real.\"\\nOwen: He isn\\'t?!\\nChandler : We have to get out of here, baby!\\n\\nRoss: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.\\nRachel: Ooy.\\nRoss: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is   life without love?\\nRachel: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?\\nRoss: O is for \"oh, wow!\" The V is for this very surprising turn   of   events, which I\\'m still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely   normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might   get married and have children of your own.\\nJoey: Dude, are you okay?\\nRoss: Totally.\\nRachel: Ross, you don\\'t seem okay.\\nRoss : I\\'m sorry, it must be the pressure of   entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.\\nCharlie: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.\\nRoss: No!\\nCharlie: I\\'m sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but   this has been lovely.\\nRoss: Wasn\\'t it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and   that you never really liked Rachel.\\nCharlie: You\\'re on fire! I\\'ll call you in the morning, okay?\\nRoss: Okay.\\nCharlie: Alright.\\nCharlie: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..\\nRachel: Oh, that\\'s okay, girls tend not to like me.\\nCharlie: Bye.\\nRoss: Okay, I guess it\\'s just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!\\nRachel: You know what, Ross? I think we\\'re gonna take off too.\\nRoss: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I\\'m so stupid. You guys are a couple   now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.\\nRachel: No, no, it\\'s just that it\\'s getting late...\\nRoss: Hey, hey, it\\'s fine. It\\'s totally fine. We\\'ve got plenty of   margaritas. It\\'s all good.\\nRoss: I don\\'t even know what that\\'s for.\\nJoey: You know what? I think I\\'m gonna stay here and make sure he\\'s   okay.\\nRachel: Yeah, that\\'s probably a good idea.\\nJoey: Yeah. I\\'ll see you in the morning.\\nRachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don\\'t think he\\'s ever   gonna be okay with this.\\nJoey: It doesn\\'t look good, does it?\\n\\nJoey: Morning. Here you go.\\nRoss: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nRoss: So you took off my pants and shoes?\\nJoey: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the   Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you   don\\'t have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.\\nRoss: What do you mean?\\nJoey: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren\\'t gonna do   anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..\\nRoss: Hey, what are you talking about? I\\'m fine!\\nJoey: It\\'s okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you\\'re   not fine. You\\'re.. You\\'re Ross and Rachel.\\nRoss: Except we\\'re not. I mean, we haven\\'t been a couple in like, six   years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?\\nJoey: That\\'s what I hear, yeah.\\nRoss: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys   aren\\'t gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is   this thing with you and Rachel?\\nJoey: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...\\nRoss: Joey.\\nJoey: I\\'m crazy about her.\\nRoss: And she feels the same way?\\nJoey: I think so.\\nRoss: Well, then, maybe it\\'s time we all moved on.\\nJoey: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you\\'re not okay with it.\\nRoss: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I\\'m with Charlie,   right? Oh my god, I\\'m still with Charlie, aren\\'t I? I mean, she didn\\'t   see the dance, did she?\\nJoey: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure   about this?\\nRoss: Yeah, I\\'m sure.\\nJoey: And we\\'re okay?\\n   ENDING CREDITS\\n\\nMonica: Hey, Phoebs\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nMonica: Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate   us.\\nChandler: Owen didn\\'t know he was adopted, and Monica told him.\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: Still, he had to find out sometime.\\nChandler: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets   that you gave birth to them?\\nChandler: I\\'m gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-03\\nWritten by: Brian Buckner   Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa\\nChandler: So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?\\nJoey: Yeah. It\\'s actually our first official date\\nChandler: Wow! So tonight may be the night! You\\'re nervous?\\nJoey: Naa, no.

I know exactly what I\\'m gonna do!\\nChandler: Really? Like you have a routine?\\nJoey: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have   to appreciate their uniqueness.\\nChandler: Really?\\nJoey: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.   Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.\\nChandler: You mean like this?\\nJoey: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.\\nChandler: Oh, I see what you mean, that\\'s quite nice.\\nJoey: More foosball?\\nChandler: ...and beer!!\\n   OPENING CREDITS\\nMonica:  Hey!\\nRoss and Chandler: Hey!\\nMonica:\\nRoss:  WOW!\\nChandler: Hey! Stop staring at my wife\\'s legs! No no! Stop   staring at your sister\\'s legs!\\nRoss: I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just... how did you get so tan?\\nChandler: She went on one of those spray-on tan places.\\nRoss: Eh, you got a spray-on tan?\\nMonica: Chandler gets pedicures!\\nRoss:  Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?\\nChandler:  Why...why?\\nRoss: Still, I can\\'t believe that\\'s sprayed on... I mean,   it looks really good.

Here\\'s their card.\\nRoss: Thanks.\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey Pheebs!\\nMonica: Hey Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: Oh, you won\\'t believe who moved back to town.\\nMonica: I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me   too! She\\'s the worst!\\nChandler: Who\\'s Amanda?\\nMonica: She\\'s this girl who used to live   in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up   this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  \"Monica, darling! It\\'s Amanda calling!\"\\nChandler: Are you trying to do a British accent?\\nMonica:  Chandler gets   pedicures!\\nChandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?\\nPhoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on   the phone?  \"Oh, so sorry to catch you   on your Mo-Bile!\" If-if you don\\'t wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don\\'t call   me on my mo-Bile!\"\\nMonica: I know, and she\\'s always bragging   about all the famous people she\\'s met.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I know! \"Oh...I slept with Billy Joel\".   All right, who hasn\\'t?\\nMonica: Oh, what are we gonna do! I don\\'t   wanna see her!!\\nPhoebe: Ugh, Let\\'s just cut her out!\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and   dodge her \\'till she gets the point!\\nMonica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but...   it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?\\nChandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !\\nRoss: Well... I like how you look, what are you?\\nAssistant: Puerto Rican.\\nRoss: Two, I think a two.\\nAssistant: You\\'ve got to face the red light.   When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.   When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks   then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?\\nRoss: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.\\nAssistant: Wow, you catch on quick.\\nRoss: Well, I have a PhD, so...\\nRoss: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...\\nRoss: You sprayed my front twice!\\nAssistant: You\\'ve never turned?\\nRoss: No, I barely even   got to three Mississippi.\\nAssistant: Mississippi? I said count to   five\\'!\\nRoss: Mississippilesly?  Well, how   bad is it?\\nAssistant: Ain\\'t that bad yet, but it keeps   getting darker for the next four hours.\\nRoss: So, how dark is it   gonna get?\\nAssistant: You got sprayed with two two\\'   s and...\\nRoss: I\\'m a four?\\nAssistant: Yeah, but you\\'re back\\'s a zero.   You\\'re gonna wanna even that out.\\nRoss:  Really!\\nAssistant: You might wanna get back in there.\\nRoss:  Ok!\\nRoss: Wait, wait a minute, there\\'s no light   on the back wall! How do I know when it\\'s gonna start? Hello?  The same thing   happened again!\\nAssistant: You got two more twos?\\nRoss:  I\\'m an eight!\\nJoey: I thought you paid.

This never happened to me   before! I\\'m an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can   do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!   I blame your bra!\\nRachel: Its a standard issue bra clasp!\\nJoey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That\\'s right! You threw me   off with all your slapping!\\nRachel: Ok well, well I\\'m really, I\\'m sorry about that Joey,   but do you think that maybe on some level, you don\\'t want to take   off my bra?\\nJoey:    NAH! I don\\'t have another level!!\\n   Chandler: Hold on! There is something different.\\nRoss: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.\\nChandler: Was that place... The Sun?\\nRoss: Oh! And it gets worse!\\nChandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself!\\nMonica: How could you mess this up? It\\'s   so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!\\nRoss:  How do you count to five?\\nMonica: One Two Three...\\nRoss:\\nRachel:  oooh! Oh oh!\\nRoss:  I Know!\\nRachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?\\nChandler: How was your date with Joey?\\nRachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away!\\nChandler: You didn\\'t like that?\\nRachel: Well, it wasn\\'t just me, alright? He freaked out   too! He couldn\\'t even undo my bra!\\nMonica: Wow, really? One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open.\\nRachel: I do not know what\\'s wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that\\'s been great! But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.\\nMonica: Well, you guys have been friends   forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?   You couldn\\'t stop laughing? You got through that.\\nRachel:  Ok, that\\'s true. That\\'s true,   we can do this. You\\'re right, you\\'re right, we can do this. We\\'re just gonna   power through!\\nJoey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .\\nRachel: .\\nMonica:  Chandler,   stop! It is not going to pop open!\\nChandler:\\nMonica: Hey Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica: Is Amanda here yet?\\nPhoebe: No.\\nMonica:  Oh good. Good, look   I\\'m so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.   Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.\\nPhoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here?\\nMonica: Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident?\\nPhoebe:  Are you kidding, I love it!\\nPhoebe: Hi!\\nMonica: Hi!\\nAmanda: Hi!\\nAmanda:  Hello!\\nAmanda:  Oh gosh, so Monica, you\\'re married!\\nMonica:  Yeah! Yeah! His name is   Chandler and...\\nAmanda:  It\\'s   not perfume! It\\'s me! It\\'s my natural scent!\\nPhoebe: Musty!\\nAmanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it\\'s just like   old times. I\\'m so happy you two are friends again!\\nMonica: When were we not friends?\\nAmanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was   the year I had sex with Evil Knievel .\\nMonica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.\\nAmanda:  calls and trying to avoid seeing her.\\nMonica:  You were going to cut   me out?\\nPhoebe: Well...kinda.\\nMonica: Oh My God!\\nAmanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like   a perfect arse!\\nPhoebe: Yeah well, in America you\\'re just an \"ass\".\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe:  Oh my   God. Was Mike with him?\\nMonica: Nope!\\nJoey:  Hey!\\nRachel: Hey! Got champagne?\\nJoey: Yes ma\\'am, ready to Power through!\\nRachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone   is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...\\nJoey: Uh!\\nRachel: Ok  Alright!   Lets do it!\\nJoey: Ok, you\\'re scaring me a little bit.\\nRachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we\\'ve gotta do this!  Ok. Aha! You like   that huh?\\nJoey: Oh! yeah!\\nRachel: You like that?\\nJoey: uh uh!\\nRachel: Yeah baby, I\\'ll show you how we do it!\\nJoey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!\\nRachel: What? Oh my God! I\\'m so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?\\nJoey:  Soldier down!\\nMonica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.\\nChandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!\\nPhoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you\\'re alive. Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute?\\nMonica: I have nothing to say to   you.\\nAmanda:  Wow,   my flat is twice this size!\\nPhoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall?\\nAmanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly.\\nChandler: Well, aren\\'t you a treat.\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe you tried to cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why?\\nPhoebe: It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill.\\nMonica: I\\'m still all those things!\\nPhoebe: You\\'re also so generous and kind and scrappy!\\nMonica:  I am scrappy.\\nPhoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn\\'t   keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in.\\nMonica: It\\'s because I\\'m scrappy.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you are. And I\\'m so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don\\'t know what I would do without you.\\nMonica: I won\\'t know what I would do without   you.\\nMonica: Well, I guess we should go back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I guess you\\'re right.\\nAmanda: Can you believe it. I\\'ve never had any professional   dance training.\\nGlenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the   booth, and...\\nRoss: I\\'m gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does   it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two\\'s... and I want them   all on my back.\\nGlenda:  Okay...\\nRoss: Wait a minute, there\\'s two sets of nozzles, which one   is it?\\nRoss: Which... which... which... Which one is it?\\nRoss: OH! SON OF A BITCH!\\nRachel: What is the matter with us?\\nJoey: Well, I know what\\'s the matter with me.\\nRachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult?\\nJoey: I don\\'t know.\\nChandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey!\\nRachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that?\\nChandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys...\\nRachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...\\nJoey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?\\nChandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can\\'t believe we haven\\'t been doing this the whole time.\\nChandler: I can tell from your expressions that that\\'s the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I\\'m gonna go continue to... spread the   joy.\\nRachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn\\'t mean it has to happen that way for us.\\nJoey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something\\'s   difficult doesn\\'t mean that you quit.\\nRachel: Right, totally.\\nJoey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it.\\nRachel: Yeah, and if doesn\\'t work, then we\\'ll be just one   of those couples that never have sex.\\nJoey: That\\'s a... pla-an.\\nJoey:  Wow... I did not see this coming.\\nRachel: I know.      Joey: I don\\'t get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted.\\nRachel: Hmmm... Me too...\\nRachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?\\nJoey: I guess they weren\\'t as good friends as we are.\\nRachel: Aah... I bet you\\'re right.\\nJoey: So...\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nJoey: I love ya.\\nRachel: Love you too... Alright, I\\'m going to bed.\\nJoey: Yeah, me too.\\nJoey: Ooh, yeah, I\\'m not going anywhere for a while.\\nChandler: Dude, it\\'s Chandler. Let me in.\\nRoss: Go away! I don\\'t want to see anybody.\\nChandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in.\\nRoss: Really? Did you count Mississipily?\\nRoss: Dude, you\\'re not tanned.\\nChandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this.\\nChandler: I see you later!\\n end\\n======== 10-04\\nWritten by: Dana Klein   Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa\\nMonica:  Hey guys!\\nRoss, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!\\nChandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.\\nMonica: That place in Vermont? You can  take   a hint!\\nRachel: Wait, you can\\'t go away this weekend! It\\'s Emma\\'s birthday!\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nRachel: We\\'re having a party.\\nMonica: Well, can\\'t you just have the party when we get back?\\nRoss: No.\\nRachel: No,    that day... that won\\'t be her real birthday!\\nChandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday    was!\\nRoss: C\\'mon you guys, this is really important to us.\\nMonica: Well, I\\'m sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.    You know, to reconnect... emotionally.\\nChandler: There\\'s this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...\\nRachel: Well, can\\'t you just go to Vermont the next day?\\nRoss: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing    weird sex stuff to my little sister.\\nRachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can    we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!\\nMonica: All right, we\\'ll stay. We can just drive up after the party.\\nChandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this    party...\\nMonica: Believe me, that is not why we won\\'t    be doing that!\\n   OPENING CREDITS\\nRachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would    hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure    map to help me find \\'em all.\\nPhoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm...    when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood    to buy us food!\\nRoss:  Hey guys!\\nRachel and Phoebe: Hi!\\nRoss: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma\\'s video.\\nRachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma    and we\\'ll give it to her when she is 18.\\nPhoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it\\'s like a time capsule!\\nRoss: Yeah!\\nPhoebe: Oh, just think... she\\'s gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn\\'t    even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And    they\\'ll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant    people!\\nRoss: That\\'s the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?\\nRachel: Oh no, it\\'s still nap time. But she\\'ll be up soon.\\nRoss: Ah, and where is Joey?\\nRachel: I said it\\'s still nap time.\\nRoss:  Hey, there is uncle Joey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRoss: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!\\nJoey: 18, uh?       Ross: Joey, NO!\\nJoey: What, what!? it\\'s for her hot friends!\\nRoss: When they see this you\\'ll be 52!\\nJoey: And starting to think about settling down!\\nRachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma\\'s presents    on?\\nJoey: I\\'d love to! Yeah!       Joey:  We were supposed to bring presents?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.\\nJoey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?\\nPhoebe: Joey, it\\'s a birthday party.\\nJoey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What\\'s the point... the other day she laughed    for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as    a farmer. And he\\'s standing next to this cow and the cow says \"El-moo\"!     Yeah... that\\'s a funny cup!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey hey! Where\\'s the birthday girl?\\nRachel: Oh, she\\'s still napping\\nChandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party    she knows is happening.\\nRachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn\\'t    a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a    first birthday again.\\nMonica: All right... you\\'re right. We\\'re sorry. Now let\\'s wake up Emma and    get the fun time started!\\nRachel: No really, she didn\\'t sleep well last night, so we can\\'t wake her up.\\nMonica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?\\nJack and Judy: HI!\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nMonica: So glad you came!\\nJack: I can\\'t believe Emma is already one!\\nJudy:  There\\'s something you didn\\'t know    about your dad!\\nJoey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.\\nJack: Thank you!\\nJoey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what    would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!\\nJack: Which one are you?\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe Emma is still asleep!\\nChandler: I know, what are we gonna do?\\nMonica: I\\'ve got a plan. I\\'ve got a plan. I\\'m going to ram this platter really    hard into your ribs. You\\'re gonna scream out and that\\'ll wake her up!\\nChandler: I\\'m not going to Vermont with this Monica!\\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,    maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!      Phoebe: So youre gonna... hit on her?\\nJoey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor!\\nPhoebe: Oh!\\nJoey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one    of her books!\\nPhoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!\\nJoey: Hey, I think Emma might like it!\\nRachel: Oh! Emma might like what?\\nJoey: Um, my present!\\nRachel: What did you get her?\\nJoey: Actually we prepared performances.\\nPhoebe: Separate performances.\\nJoey: But equally real!\\nRachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are    getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind    performing them once now?\\nPhoebe: Sure, yeah!\\nJoey:  O K.\\nRachel:  All right, lets get this party started, huh?    Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.\\nRoss: Oh, great!\\nPhoebe:  Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing    prepared?\\nJoey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole    crew waiting!\\nRachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?\\nJoey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emmas books.\\nRachel: Oh, ok, which one?\\nJoey: Uh, why, its a... .    And while he rocked her, he sang Ill love you forever, Ill    like you for always, as long as I\\'m living, my baby youll be.\\nRachel:  Wow! That was amazing!\\nRoss: Thank you so much for that gift!\\nChandler : I was not ready for this today!\\nRoss: Amazing... amazing.\\nRachel: Oh, Phoebe, Im sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.\\nPhoebe: Thats right, I\\'ve prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to    hers. For theres no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. \\'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!    Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy    birthday Emma!\\nRachel: Is that it?\\nPhoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading  Finding your G-spot.\\nEverybody: No, no, no, no, no!\\nJudy: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.\\nJack: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.\\nJudy: Yes, youll be all grown up by then. Well be... Well your    grandfather and I might not be here.\\nJack: Thats true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the    grave, Emma!\\nJudy: After all, my parents died very young.\\nJack: And my cholesterols off the charts!\\nJudy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!\\nRoss : Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was    just... yeah!\\nRachel: Ross, um, dont forget to get a shot of Emmas cake. Its    in a box in the fridge.\\nRoss: Sure.\\nRachel: Oh, you\\'re gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey,    Corinos.\\nMonica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike    there when I was a kid.\\nRachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different    shapes, and if you give them a photo, theyll copy it in icing!\\nMonica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?\\nRachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.\\nRoss: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say    for bachelorette parties?\\nRachel: Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God!    They put my babys face on a penis!\\nPhoebe : oh! Now its a party!\\nRachel: Why you guys this isn\\'t funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to    be a disaster I would have baked it myself!\\nJoey : Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?\\nJudy: Jack, look at this.\\nJack: I know what you\\'re thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!\\nRoss: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.\\nRachel : No, no, this is not what I ordered.    Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for    my daughters birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!\\nRoss: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the    penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!\\nRachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don\\'t even    want it in my home...  Joey, don\\'t touch it!!\\nJoey: I\\'m so confused!\\nRachel:  Yes, yes. I still want    my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with    nuts!\\nChandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.\\nRoss: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could    go and get the cake.\\nMonica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, \\'till I dropped the key!\\nRoss: Well, you know what? While we\\'re waiting, you guys could tape your message    to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!\\nChandler: Hi Emma! It\\'s the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?\\nMonica: We\\'re Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.   You may not recognize us, because we haven\\'t spoken to your parents in seventeen years!\\nChandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together    and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.\\nMonica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to    go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in    a half hour.\\nPhoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.\\nRoss: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be    back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?\\nMonica: Alright, 5 more minutes.\\nRoss:\\nChandler: Was that Emma? Is she up?\\nRoss: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot    her licence so now I have to bring it to her.\\nPhoebe: Well, if you\\'re leaving, I\\'m definitely gonna go.\\nMonica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it\\'s us     We\\'ve been complaining the longest!\\nRoss: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can\\'t leave! Rachel already feels bad    that the cake\\'s messed up. How do you think she\\'s gonna feel when she comes    back here and all you guys are gone?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know! You\\'ll tell us on Monday!\\nRoss: Joey! You\\'re in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!\\nJoey: Got it!  Where do you think you\\'re going?\\nChandler: To the bathroom!\\nJoey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we\\'re gonna    be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!\\nPhoebe: Oh no! He\\'s not getting away that easy!\\nChandler:\\nJoey: Well, that one did not have Emma\\'s face on it.\\nPhoebe: No, it did not.\\nJoey: No.\\nJudy: Well, we better get going, it\\'s late. Jack\\'s not allowed to drive at    night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.\\nJack: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger    scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.\\nJudy: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.\\nJoey: Ok!\\nJudy: Bye... Bye dear.\\nJoey: Nighty-night!\\nJudy: Nighty-night!\\nJoey: Bye, bye.\\nPhoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?\\nJoey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I\\'m not gonna mess with Jack, he\\'s a great man, he    fought for our country.\\nMonica: No, he didn\\'t! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.\\nJoey:\\nChandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?\\nJoey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here!\\nJoey: Hello?\\nEstelle:  Joey! It\\'s Estelle!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nEstelle: So, how did your audition go today?\\nJoey:  What audition?\\nEstelle: The one I told you about last week?\\nJoey: What? You never said anything about an audition!\\nEstelle:  Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition.    I think you can still make it. It\\'s down at the Astor Theatre and you need to    have a monologue prepared.\\nJoey: A monologue? I don\\'t have..     Aah! so... I\\'m gonna take off!\\nPhoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don\\'t get to leave! I\\'ve got a massage client    waiting outside my door any minute!\\nMonica: Yeah, and we\\'ve paid for a room, that we\\'re supposed to be in right    now!\\nPhoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as    the person who realized that, I get to go!\\nMonica: No! no! Let\\'s figure out a fair way to decide who\\'s staying.\\nJoey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever    gets the highest number gets to go first.\\nMonica:  Ok, ten.\\nJoey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?\\nPhoebe: No, lets just draw straws.\\nJoey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..\\nChandler: I\\'m begging you stop.\\nJoey: Right.\\nMonica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday.    We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!\\nPhoebe:  Yeah!! Let\\'s do that!\\nChandler:  That sounds more fun than the thing we were going    to do in Vermont!\\nMonica: Everybody get your toys!\\nPhoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!\\nChandler: Thats a bear.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m too excited!\\nMonica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler    and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes    in last, stays!\\nJoey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!\\nChandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!\\nPhoebe: Go! Go!\\nJoey: Come on robot!\\nMonica:  What are you barking at?\\nMonica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?\\nChandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that\\'s all you do?\\nJoey: Way to go robot!\\nPhoebe: Good job Alan!\\nJoey: Hey, good race you guys.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, see you later!\\nMonica: No! No, no... wait! We didn\\'t lose.  The rules clearly    stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog    never crossed the finish line, so technically...\\nChandler: They left.\\n   Rachel:  Bye...\\nRoss: RACHEL!\\nRachel: OOH! God! Sorry!\\nRoss:  I can\\'t believe they gave you a ticket. You\\'re such a    good driver.\\nRachel: Emma\\'s awake.\\nRoss: Yeah?\\nRachel: I can\\'t believe this. This is her first birthday. She\\'s awake. We\\'re    not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.\\nRoss: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.\\nRachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday...    And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According    to the back cover of that book that you gave me.\\nRoss: Rach, she\\'s not going to remember this.\\nRachel:  They have to learn!\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss: It\\'s not bad.\\nRachel:  Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a    bunny. How did you do that?\\nRoss: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this    to make ears.\\nRachel: Well, I\\'m very impressed.\\nRoss: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into    woodland creatures.\\n   Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?\\nMonica: Game?\\nChandler: Emma, you even know it\\'s your birthday today? You\\'re one! One-year-old,    that\\'s little.\\nChandler: Ooh! That\\'s my girl!\\nMonica: That\\'s how old you are.\\nChandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?\\nMonica:  Ooh, I want one...\\nChandler: Me too...\\nChandler: There\\'s no-one around. Why don\\'t we just take this one?\\nMonica: ...and head to Canada!\\nChandler: I was kidding.\\nMonica: I wasn\\'t. Let\\'s get going!\\nPhoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?\\nChandler: No, not yet.\\nPhoebe: Oh good, I didn\\'t miss the party.\\nMonica: What about your massage client?\\nPhoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something,    you know. As long as I\\'m back in five or six hours, it will be alright.\\nJoey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I\\'ve been here the whole time. THE WHOLE    TIME!\\nJoey:  I\\'ve been here the whole time!\\nRoss: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.\\nRachel: I don\\'t care that you left. I\\'m just glad that you\\'re here. Thanks    you guys!\\nChandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.\\nRachel: What?\\nChandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?\\nEmma: Wo-ish.\\nRachel: Oh! Emma, that\\'s right! You\\'re that many!\\nRoss: Oh my God! Our daughter\\'s a genius! Rach, this means...\\nRachel:  NO, no science camp!\\nRoss: Damnit! I\\'ll put a candle on the cake.\\nRachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!\\nMonica: Thanks!\\nRoss: Okay, here we go! Emma\\'s first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow    out the candle. Come on Emma.\\nChandler: Let\\'s do it, come on!\\nRoss: What\\'s wrong? Are you okay?\\nRachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.\\nPhoebe:  Hey, you made it into a bunny.\\nJoey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it    was a penis.\\nENDING CREDITS\\nRachel: Okay.\\nRoss: Okay, you ready?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nRoss: A-a-and... record.\\nRachel: Okay.  Hi Emma.

I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me.\\nJoey: Yeah, Monica made us!\\nRachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, \\'cause I dont    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasnt for you guys.    See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know its gonna    take patience, but thats ok.\\nAmy: Good morning.\\nJoey: Yeaah.\\nRachel: Amy, thats what I was supposed to wear today, thats why    I hung it on the door.\\nAmy: Oh, sweety, you cant pull this off.\\nRachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it\\'d be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.\\nAmy: Oh, I cant, honey. Im gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.     Oh... sure you wanna eat that?\\nJoey:  IM CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!\\nPhoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.\\nChandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.\\nMonica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song.\\nRoss: Seriously?\\nChandler: Word!\\nPhoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.\\nRachel: Well, what happened?\\nPhoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing...\\nRachel: Oh, that is so tacky.\\nPhoebe: Well, thats what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night!\\nMonica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?\\nRachel: Phoebe, thats huge!\\nRoss: Well, do you wanna marry him?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, I dont think hes ever gonna ask again! I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this!\\nChandler: She\\'s right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a   guy..?\\nMonica: Maybe you don\\'t need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, isn\\'t that a little desperate?\\nMonica: I proposed to Chandler!  Alright,    moving on...\\nChandler: Oh, I don\\'t think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!\\nMonica: Thank you.\\nPhoebe:  Well, do you think   I should propose?\\nRachel: I think it could be kind of great!\\nRoss: Absolutely! You\\'ll love the feeling! There\\'s nothing like it!\\nPhoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?\\nMonica: How about at a game, on the big screen?\\nRachel:\\nMonica: What? what? He obviously thinks that\\'s a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he\\'d never suspect it!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?\\nChandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?\\nAmy:\\nRachel:  Oh! That\\'s interesting, since she died seven years    ago!!\\nAmy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?\\nRachel:  That\\'s Molly, she\\'s sick. Can you watch Emma today?\\nRoss: No, I can\\'t. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?    Because my throat\\'s been hurting?\\nRachel: Menstrual cramps.\\nRoss: I don\\'t think that\\'s what this is.\\nRachel:  Can any of you watch Emma?\\nMonica: No, sorry sweety..\\nPhoebe: No, I\\'ve got work and then I\\'m proposing..\\nRachel:  Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?\\nAmy: Well, I can do it.\\nRachel:  Well, actually...\\nRoss:  Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nRoss: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.\\nRachel: Why not?\\nRoss: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!      Rachel:  Wha.. well, Ella\\'s a nice name!\\nRoss: Fine, we\\'ll call the next one Ella.\\nRachel:  Wha... the next one?\\nRoss:  Okay, um... I don\\'t want her watching our baby.\\nRachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge    breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!\\nRoss: I... I don\\'t know..\\nRachel: Ross, I\\'m telling you, she\\'s giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand    how important that is in our world?\\nAmy: um... listen, I couldn\\'t help but overhear... \\'cause I was trying to...    Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel\\'s    been so wonderful to me...\\nRachel: Absolutely.\\nAmy:\\nChandler: Hey Joe! How\\'s the second draft of the letter coming?\\nJoey: Great, I\\'m finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.\\nMonica: You dropped it off?\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nChandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?\\nJoey: No can do amigo. No, I didn\\'t use the computer. Felt more personal to    hand-write it.\\nMonica: You hand-wrote it?\\nJoey: Yeah, and don\\'t worry. I didn\\'t try to sound smart at   all! See ya later!\\nMonica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file! We\\'re never gonna get a kid. No, we\\'re gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!\\nChandler: It\\'s ok, it\\'s ok. You know what?\\nMonica: Okay good.\\nChandler: .\\nMonica: Ugh, we\\'re screwed, aren\\'t we? You know what? Just tell me on the way    to the bird store.\\nChandler:  They loved it.\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter.\\nMonica:  They thought Joey was a child?\\nChandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.\\nAmy: Hi!\\nMonica: Hey, what did you guys do today?\\nAmy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.\\nChandler: That sounds like fun.\\nAmy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.\\nRachel:  Hey! Hi, how\\'s my girl?\\nAmy: I\\'m fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?\\nRachel:  Yeah!\\nAmy: Ta-daaa!\\nRachel:  You pierced her ears!?\\nAmy:  Doesn\\'t it make her nose look smaller?\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\n   Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?\\nAmy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn\\'t have been surprise, now would    it?\\nChandler: I think she looks cute.     ... but I am wrong!\\nRachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He\\'s gonna flip out.\\nAmy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?\\nRachel: Ugh.\\nRoss: Hey guys.       Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.\\nRoss: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.    .\\nRachel: Nah, I don\\'t really want her to see.\\nRoss: Why not?\\nMonica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.\\nChandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey\\'s refrigerator. Remember? It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat?\\nRoss: Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!\\nRoss:  What?\\nRachel: Nothing.\\nRoss: . Please tell me those are clip-ons.\\nRachel: Oh, they\\'re real!\\nRoss: Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn\\'t have    left Emma with her!\\nRachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross.    You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!\\nAmy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs    to have a cool fun aunt!\\nMonica: I\\'m a cool, fun aunt!\\nAmy:  O-Okay!\\nChandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!\\nRachel: I can\\'t believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?\\nAmy: Well, I don\\'t need you to help me, because I already know what I\\'m going    to do with my life.\\nRachel: Oh yeah? Since when?\\nAmy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.\\nRachel:  What?\\nRoss: That\\'s not a thing!\\nAmy: Well, it should be. I\\'m gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what    colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...\\nRachel:  Babies don\\'t care if they\\'re slim.\\nAmy: Enter Amy!\\nRoss:  Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...\\nAmy: What? What are you gonna do?\\nRoss:  No more falafel for you!\\nMike: Great game, huh?\\nPhoebe: Uhuh, uhuh...\\nMike: Why do you keep looking at the screen?\\nPhoebe: I\\'m not. I\\'m praying.  Where... where are you going?\\nMike: Going go to the bathroom.\\nPhoebe: Well, I think you should wait.\\nMike: Why?\\nPhoebe: Well, if you don\\'t... if you don\\'t hold it in, you don\\'t get all the    nutrients.\\nAnnouncer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.\\nPhoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?\\nAnnouncer: Get a load of this... She\\'s proposing   to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.\\nPhoebe: That\\'s not very enlightened!\\nPhoebe: Hey, hey!  Boo us? Boo you!\\nJoey:  She was    nice!\\nRachel: Joey, get Amy\\'s bags, she is moving out!\\nJoey: Whoo-hoo!\\nAmy: You\\'re kicking me out?\\nRachel: You put holes in my baby\\'s ears!\\nAmy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!\\nRachel:  I can\\'t believe I ever even tried to help   you. You are so  beyond help.\\nAmy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.\\nRachel: Excuse me?\\nAmy: You didn\\'t want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then,    I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws  And suddenly I am the bad guy?\\nRachel:  Joey, where are those bags?\\nJoey:  She has a lot of crap!\\nAmy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great.    Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without    that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...\\nRachel:  Seriously?\\nAmy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.\\nRachel: Hips or thighs?\\nAmy: Ass and face.\\nRachel:  Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.\\nAmy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking    about real stuff.\\nRachel:  Oh, I can give you that.\\nAmy: You can?\\nRachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you\\'re...    you\\'re already a pretty perfect version of what you are.\\nAmy:  Thank you. I\\'ve got to admit, Emma does look cute.\\nRachel: Did you just say Emma?\\nAmy: Ugh, I\\'m sorry... Ella.\\nPhoebe: That woman at the game didn\\'t know what she was talking    about. Mike, obviously you have balls.\\nMike: But please, let\\'s just forget the whole thing.\\nPhoebe:  I would love it. Consider    it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I\\'ll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s in the cake, isn\\'t it?\\nMike:\\nPhoebe: What\\'s the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I\\'m sorry, I\\'m    sorry!\\nMike: No! It\\'s my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and    all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my    life with you.\\nMike: I\\'m gonna do this now.\\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\\nMike: Phoebe, I...\\nPhoebe: Wait! Oh wait!\\nMike: Ready?\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh!\\nMike: Phoebe, I love you. There\\'s no-one else in the world I would ask to marry    me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow    old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?\\nPhoebe: Yes!\\nMike: I love you!\\nPhoebe: I love you more!\\nMike: Not possible!  She\\'s gonna    be Mrs. No Balls.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nRachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?\\nAmy: Not that great. It\\'s almost if people don\\'t want to hear that their babies    are ugly.\\nRachel: That\\'s shocking!\\nAmy: Oh! It\\'s Ross... Hey Ross!  He\\'s rude!\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-06\\nWritten by: Sebastian Jones   Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa    Final check by    Kim\\nPhoebe:  Hey...\\nAll: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nRoss: Pheebs, what\\'s wrong?\\nPhoebe: Oh, I\\'m just so exhausted from dragging around this...     HUGE engagement ring!\\nAll: OH!\\nRachel: My God!\\nJoey: Hey!      Rachel: Congratulations!

Well...  To Phoebe and Mike!\\nAll: Whoo!\\nPhoebe: Thank you!  Oh, and I have something for    you!\\nRachel: Mmh-mmh!\\nPhoebe: It\\'s, yes, my little black book. It\\'s got the numbers    of all the guys I\\'ve dated.\\nRachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that\\'s nice but, you know what,    I think I\\'m ok. Why don\\'t you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?\\nPhoebe: I would, but you\\'re the last one.\\nRachel:  Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, \"Guy-in-van\"?\\nPhoebe: Oh, my first love!\\nRachel: Oh!\\nMonica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore\\'s name mean?\\nPhoebe: Dead.  Oh, it\\'s OK, no,   he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave   at Omaha Beach.\\nChandler: Hey, I\\'m sorry, I should have given you guys my    black book when I got married! Although it wasn\\'t so much a book as a... napkin.    With Janice\\'s phone number on it.\\nRachel: Phoebe, isn\\'t Jethro Tull a band?\\nPhoebe:  Oh yes, they are.\\n   OPENING CREDITS\\nChandler:  Hey honey!\\nJoey:  Hi sweetie!\\nChandler: Is Monica not here?\\nJoey: No.\\nChandler: Oh, then I\\'ll tell you. My agency was bidding for   a big account and they got it! It\\'s my first national commercial!\\nJoey: Cool!\\nChandler: Yeah, and I don\\'t wanna brag but a lot of the ideas    were mine!  Hell, you weren\\'t there? All the ideas were   mine!!!\\nJoey: That\\'s great! Hey, can you cast me in it?\\nChandler: Oh... I don\\'t know, I really don\\'t think you\\'re    right for the part.\\nJoey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I\\'m a chameleon!    Huh?  I\\'m cold!! Huh??    Come on! What can\\'t I do?\\nChandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don\\'t think    you\\'re right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.\\nJoey: I can do that!  \"Hello, I\\'m    your professor. When I\\'m not busy thinking of important things or... professing.    I like to use...\" Oh, what\\'s the product?\\nChandler: Software that facilitates inter-business networking    e-solutions?\\nJoey:  I\\'m cold!\\nRoss:  Hey!\\nCharlie: Hey!\\nRoss: Guess who\\'s a finalist for a huge research   grant!  I\\'ll give you a hint, he\\'s looking right at you.\\nCharlie: Ah, well, unless it\\'s the creepy guy with his hand    up his kilt, I\\'m gonna say congratulations!\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'m so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds    of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not      that I\\'m keeping score or anything... five!\\nCharlie: Wow, that\\'s great! So, tell me about the grant!\\nRoss: Well, ok, it\\'s for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get    it, I\\'ll finally be able to complete my field research! And there    will be  an article about me in the \"Paleontology Review\"! Yeah!    That\\'ll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious    questions    about my work!\\nCharlie: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?\\nRoss: Yeah. Why?\\nCharlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.\\nRoss: Your ex-boyfriend?\\nCharlie: Yeah.\\nRoss: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new    boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!\\nCharlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything,    I think this could help you. You know what? Why don\\'t we all go out to dinner    together, and I can introduce you.\\nRoss: Well, if you think it would help.\\nCharlie: Yes, absolutely. I\\'ll call him.\\nRoss: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,    butter him up? Anything he really likes?\\nCharlie: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.\\nRoss: We\\'ll see how dinner goes.\\nPhoebe:  Hey!\\nMonica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?\\nPhoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing    out stuff, so Mike could move in.\\nMonica: Oh, right.\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nMonica: Oh, well. Now that I\\'m here I might as well help you    with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!\\nPhoebe: Oh, it\\'s so hard to get rid of stuff! Did   you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?\\nMonica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?      Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me    to get rid of Gladys.\\nMonica: Who\\'s Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!\\nPhoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,   I know!! Oh, you should take her!\\nMonica:  Well, I-I-I-I... I don\\'t know...\\nPhoebe: Why, you don\\'t like her?\\nMonica: Well, of course I do. What\\'s not to like! I\\'ll    take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you\\'re giving up too    easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!\\nPhoebe: Really? You think?\\nMonica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him \"I\\'m sorry    Mike I can\\'t live without her, she means too much to me!\"\\nPhoebe: Ok, I\\'ll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just    realized... if I do that, that means you don\\'t get her.\\nMonica: Damn it, I did not think this through!\\n\\nChandler: Hey you guys.\\nRachel: Hi!\\nJoey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?\\nChandler: Joe, I told you, you\\'re just not right for    the part.\\nJoey: What do you mean? Rach, don\\'t I seem like a professor    you\\'d buy some kind of e-crap from?\\nRachel: I\\'m sorry, this sounds like something I\\'m never gonna    be interested in.\\nJoey . Look, here\\'s a    copy of my reels. It\\'s got all the commercials that I\\'ve been in.\\nChandler: Joe...\\nJoey: Just watch it, and if you don\\'t like it, you don\\'t    pass it on to your bosses!\\nChandler: Fine!\\nJoey: Thank you.\\nChandler: Work, Joe!\\nJoey: Damn it!\\nChandler : What am I gonna do now?\\nJoey: Just pass it to your boss!\\nChandler: He\\'s not right for the part. So if I suggest    him, my bosses are gonna think I\\'m an idiot! And that\\'s something they should    learn on their own!\\nRachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked    it, but your bosses didn\\'t. Then that way, you\\'re the good guy and    they\\'re the bad guys.\\nChandler: That\\'s good! I liked it, they didn\\'t.    .\\n   Ross: I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to meet Benjamin Hobart.    I\\'ve always thought of him as one of the people I\\'d invite to my fantasy dinner    party. Do you think there\\'s any chance he\\'ll bring Christie Brinkley    or C3PO?\\nCharlie:  Sorry, looks    like it\\'s just him.\\nBenjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!\\nRoss: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.\\nBenjamin: So good to see you.\\nCharlie: Me too.\\nRoss: I\\'m ok.\\nCharlie: I\\'m sorry...  Ross    Geller... Benjamin Hobart.\\nRoss: It\\'s an honor to meet you. I can\\'t tell    you how long I\\'ve been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,     whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you\\'re one of    the reasons I got into the field.\\nBenjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I\\'ve    never heard of you until this morning, but, it\\'s nice to be nice!\\nCharlie: Shall we? .\\nBenjamin: . I can\\'t    believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?\\nCharlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! .\\nBenjamin : You weren\\'t there!\\nRoss: No, but, it\\'s, you know, it\\'s just a funny image,    you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz,    mmm.\\nCharlie: Ross, why don\\'t you tell Benji about your proposal,    while I go to the ladies room?\\nBenjamin: So, tell me about it.\\nRoss: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.\\nBenjamin: M-m.\\nRoss: See, there are still several areas that haven\\'t    been fully excavated.\\nBenjamin: Break up with Charlie!\\nRoss: What?\\nBenjamin: What?\\nRoss: Did you just say \"break up with Charlie\"?\\nBenjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I    didn\\'t not say it.\\nRoss: Kind of inappropriate, don\\'t you think?\\nBenjamin: I\\'m sorry. I just haven\\'t seen her for so    long! All these feelings are rushing back! I\\'m starting to realize how much    I missed her, and I\\'m gonna need you to break up with her.\\nRoss: Are you serious?\\nBenjamin: If you say yes then I\\'m serious, if you say no then    I\\'m joking!\\nRoss: No!\\nBenjamin: Joking it is!\\nPhoebe: Hi! Sorry, I\\'m late.\\nMonica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you    keep the painting?\\nPhoebe: No, he really hates it. But he\\'s gonna let me    keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news    is, Gladys is yours!\\nMonica: Wow, what\\'s the bad news!\\nRachel: Who\\'s Gladys?\\nPhoebe: Oh, she\\'s that work of art I made, you know,    with the woman coming out of the frame.\\nRachel:  Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?   In her house? I am so jealous!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I didn\\'t know you wanted her too!\\nMonica: Huh!\\nRachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already    gave that to Monica, so...\\nMonica: You know, I would give her up, for you.\\nRachel: No, I couldn\\'t let you do that.\\nMonica: But I want to.\\nRachel: But I don\\'t want you to.\\nMonica: But I insist!\\nRachel: But I insist harder!\\nPhoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We\\'ll flip a coin. Heads,    she\\'s Rachel\\'s, tails she\\'s Monica\\'s. . Tails! Monica, she\\'s yours!\\nMonica: No, that landed in your food!\\nRachel:  No, no, that\\'s ok. You won fair    and square. I\\'m so sad!\\nChandler: Hey Joe!\\nJoey: What\\'s up?\\nChandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren\\'t interested.\\nJoey:  Oh.\\nChandler:  I\\'m sorry man.\\nJoey:  But, ehm... you watched    the tape?\\nChandler:  But, ehm... my bosses didn\\'t go for it.    Stupid sons of bitches!\\nJoey:  You didn\\'t watch the tape.\\nChandler:  What!? Of course I did!\\nJoey: Look, it\\'s one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?\\nChandler: I\\'m not lying to you, I watched it!\\nJoey: Well, you lied again!\\nChandler: I watched it!\\nJoey: Keep going Pinocchio!\\nChandler:  I did!\\nJoey:\\nChandler:\\nRachel: Did you watch the tape?\\nChandler:    No!\\nBenjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of    you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers    you give to the questions I ask here. I\\'m gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you    claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you    propose to correct this problem?\\nDr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological    evidence. I plan to begin there.\\nBenjamin:  Interesting.\\nRoss:  I guess!\\nBenjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.    Where might that take place?\\nDr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.\\nBenjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my    birthday?\\nRoss:\\nBenjamin: Care to venture a guess?\\nRoss:  May 12th?\\nBenjamin:  Dr. Li, how many graduate students    you\\'d be needing?\\nDr. Li: Half a dozen.\\nBenjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely?\\nDr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis.\\nBenjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit    was later covered by a popular British invasion band?\\nRoss:  Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.\\nBenjamin: No! I\\'m sorry, we were looking for \"Baby It\\'s    You\". Baby It\\'s You.\\nRoss: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my    questions have anything to do with Paleontology.\\nBenjamin: You\\'re right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.    Spell \"Boscodictiasaur\".\\nRoss:  um... I\\'ve never heard of a \"Boscodictiasaur\".\\nBenjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.\\nRoss:  B - O - S ...\\nBenjamin: No, it starts with a silent \"M\".\\nRoss: Oh come on!!\\nChandler: I can\\'t believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!\\nRachel: But you are a liar.\\nChandler: What did I just say?\\nJoey: You still here?\\nChandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am    insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...\\nJoey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?    First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about    lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying    about... lying...  Stop lying!\\nChandler: Why are you so sure I didn\\'t watch this tape?\\nJoey:\\nRachel: Well, this is going well.\\nJoey:\\n   Joey: .\\nChandler: He really is a chameleon.\\nPhoebe:\\nMonica:  Oh, my!\\nRachel:\\n   Monica:  I haven\\'t really settled on a spot yet!\\nRachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be    the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!\\nPhoebe:  Yeah, yeah! And you can    get rid of that French poster.\\nMonica:  I like that poster!\\nPhoebe: Really? It doesn\\'t have anything coming out of it.    Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?\\nRachel:  Oh! There\\'s    nothing above your bed!!\\nMonica:  Are you still here?\\n      Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology    related questions? Uhm... your grandmother\\'s nickname, perhaps?     Aunt Margaret\\'s pants size?\\nBenjamin: I\\'ve come here to apologize. I think I may have    let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.\\nRoss:  No! Stop!\\nBenjamin: Anyway, I\\'ve decided to offer you the grant.\\nRoss:  Really?\\nBenjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...\\nRoss: I have to break up with Charlie?\\nBenjamin: Hey, you got one right!\\nRoss: You\\'re crazy.\\nBenjamin: Crazy, or... romantic?\\nRoss: Crazy!\\nBenjamin: Ooor...\\nRoss:\\nRachel: O-oh my God!\\nJoey:  What?\\nRachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?\\nJoey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very    reasonable price.\\nRachel: Joey, we\\'re not keeping this!\\nJoey: But it\\'s an original Buffay...\\nRachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don\\'t    mind that she\\'s haunted.\\nJoey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?\\nRachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive    when you\\'re asleep.\\nRachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body    across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.     And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your    doorknob.\\nJoey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!\\nMonica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.\\nRachel: Well, why I told him it\\'s haunted. Two can play at    this game.\\nMonica: No, too late. You can\\'t give it back!\\nRachel: Yes I can!\\nMonica: No you can\\'t. She\\'s yours!\\nRachel: She\\'s yours!\\nMonica: SHE\\'S YOURS!\\nRachel: She\\'s yours!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nRachel: She\\'s mine!\\nMonica: She\\'s m-i-i-ne!\\nRachel: She\\'s mine!\\nMonica: She\\'s mine!\\nPhoebe: You guys! You guys! You don\\'t have to fight over her    anymore.\\nRachel: I want Gladys!\\nMonica: She\\'s mine!\\nRachel: She\\'s mine!\\nMonica: She\\'s mine!\\nRachel: She\\'s mine!\\nChandler: Look, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t give them your tape. And    I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part    or not.\\nJoey: That\\'s not the point Chandler. The point is that you    lied.\\nChandler: I know. You\\'re right. What\\'s it gonna take for you    to forgive me?\\nMonica: Oh my God!\\nRachel: Excellent!\\nJoey: Now, what do you say?\\nChandler: Lying is wrong!\\nJoey: And?... AND?\\nChandler: I\\'m a pretty little girl.\\nPhoebe: I knew it!\\nRoss: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.\\nCharlie: Did you get the grant?\\nRoss: No I didn\\'t, and you want to know why? Because your    ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.\\nCharlie: What?\\nRoss: Yeah. He wouldn\\'t give me the grant, because I wouldn\\'t    give you up.\\nCharlie: Benji isn\\'t in love with me. I mean, he broke up    with me. And besides, he\\'s a very ethical man.\\nRoss: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,    who was the voice of \"Underdog\"?\\nCharlie: I\\'m sure he was just joking, Ross.\\nRoss: If you don\\'t believe me, let\\'s go talk to him, okay?    I\\'m telling you, he didn\\'t ask me one paleontological question.\\nCharlie: Seriously?\\nRoss: Oh, I\\'m sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do    you spell Mboscodictiosaur?\\nCharlie: Well, if it\\'s like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then    M-B-O...\\nRoss: Damnit!\\nBenjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are    you doing here?\\nRoss: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you    tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That\\'s the    voice of Underdog!\\nBenjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,    this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.\\nRoss: No, no, no. Don\\'t do that! I want you to look her in    the eyes, and tell her the truth.\\nCharlie: Benji?\\nBenjamin: Alright, it\\'s true. I behaved horribly. But it\\'s    only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in    my life.\\nRoss: Too little, too late, Benji!\\nCharlie: I can\\'t believe this.\\nBenjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think    about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?\\nRoss:  No!\\nCharlie: Yes!\\nRoss: What?\\nCharlie: I don\\'t know what to say, Benji. This is all so....    romantic.\\nRoss: or...\\nBenjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,    but is there any chance you will take me back?\\nCharlie: Maybe...\\nRoss: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a    little uncomfortable.\\nCharlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but...  I mean it\\'s... there\\'s so much history between us, you know...\\nBenjamin:  I\\'m sorry    too...\\nBenjamin: I love you!\\nCharlie: I love you too!\\nRoss: Okay, that\\'s it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!\\n   COMMERCIAL BREAK\\nJoey: Gladys?\\nRachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week.

The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea    how expensive this stuff was!\\nChandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the    numbers.\\nPhoebe: So what did you two do about it?\\nChandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting    solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.\\nRoss: There\\'s no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact    that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.\\nMike: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.\\nRoss: Yeah, and I\\'m responsible for just like half of that.\\nPhoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?\\nMike: Are you serious?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity    and we just got married at City Hall?\\nMike: I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.\\nRoss: I\\'ve got to say you guys, that\\'s an incredible gesture!\\nChandler:  Maybe you do that next time you get married!\\nRoss: No, no, no. The next time it\\'s gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.  But    maybe the time after that!\\n   Opening Credits\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nJoey: What\\'s going on?\\nChandler: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning    the apartment.\\nMonica:  We?\\nChandler: You know you don\\'t want me to help. You can\\'t have it both ways!\\nJoey: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?\\nChandler: Kind of. She\\'s coming by to interview us and see where we live.\\nMonica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn\\'t like something about    us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.\\nJoey: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It\\'s very    impressive when the little people know a celebrity.\\nChandler:  Little people?\\nJoey:  Celebrity.\\nMonica: Ok, so I think I\\'m just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff    hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?\\nChandler: What...? NO!\\nMonica: Chandler?\\nChandler:  I don\\'t, and I\\'m offended    by the insinuation!\\nMonica: Ok, so there\\'s not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes    taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?\\nChandler: I\\'ll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not    mine.\\nMonica: It isn\\'t mine!\\nJoey:  Well, I guess we\\'ll never know whose    it is!\\n\\nCharity guy: May I help you?\\nPhoebe: Yes. We\\'re here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.\\nCharity guy: Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.\\nPhoebe: Well, I think you\\'re gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one\\nCharity guy: Well, this is very generous!\\nPhoebe: And we don\\'t want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.\\nMike: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.\\nPhoebe: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.\\nCharity guy: Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.\\nMike: Not necessary.\\nPhoebe: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.\\nMike: And \"X\" is spelled uhm... \"Mike Hannigan\".\\nCharity guy: Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.\\nPhoebe: Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!\\nMike: It does. It feels really good!\\nPhoebe: Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!\\nCharity guy: Oh, actually, that\\'s the shirt I wore to the gym.\\nPhoebe: Mhm... it\\'s moist.\\nRoss:  Hi!\\nRachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!\\nRoss: Oh, good!\\nRachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I\\'m really sorry.\\nRoss: Oh, that\\'s OK. I\\'m sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists    out there.\\nRachel: Absolutely.\\nRoss: There was one! She\\'s it! All the rest look like they should live under    a bridge!\\nRachel: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?\\nRoss: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!\\nRachel: Oh my God, what!?\\nRoss: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and    fire!\\nRachel: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.\\nRoss: Be-caaauuuse...\\nRachel:  All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing    incident... when I was little.\\nRoss: Seriously?\\nRachel: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden    my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut    a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!\\nRoss:  And you made it through that? I wonder who\\'s gonna play you    in the movie!\\nRachel: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And    I was thinking Claire Danes.\\nRoss: Look, I\\'m sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly    safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and    you\\'ll see!\\nRachel: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you\\'re... and    there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don\\'t know if you\\'re    gonna return back to earth!\\nRoss: Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come    on, you know, when youll see the look on Emmas face, I swear you    wont regret it.\\nRachel: All right!\\nRoss: Good, you dont want to be one of those mothers who pass on their    irrational fears on their children, do you?\\nRachel: Irrational, huh? All right, well, Ill remember that the next    time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!\\nRoss: Oh, yeah, thats the same, I am sure there are thirty different    species of poisonous swings!\\nMonica: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!\\nChandler: Ok, ok, here we go.\\nMonica: Ok.\\nChandler: Here we go. Stand up straight.\\nPhoebe: Hello, is this the creepy residence?\\nMonica: Were waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, Im glad    youre here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I dont know if you wanna use it, but\\nPhoebe: Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I wont be needing    a veil, I actually wont be wearing a dress at all!\\nMonica: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!\\nPhoebe: No, no, no, were not having a big reception, we took the money    we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.\\nMonica: Thats crazy! . I am sorry. I just cant    imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!\\nPhoebe: We, you know, were different! We dont care about having    a huge party.  All right, well, who cares,    I dont need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.\\nMonica: Thats right. Youre making a commitment and thats    the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?\\nPhoebe: City Hall.\\nMonica: Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just    there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!\\nPhoebe: Its ok, its ok. I made my decision. What I really want    is a great big wedding\\nMonica: Yay!\\nChandler: But you already gave all your money to charity!\\nPhoebe: Well, Ill just ask for it back!\\nChandler: I dont think you can do that!\\nMonica: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some    stupid kids!\\nChandler: Thats sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.\\nRachel: Ok, careful.\\nRoss: Ok.\\nRachel: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!\\nRoss: Rach, shes got like three hairs!\\nRachel: I know  but theyre just so beautiful!    Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.\\nRoss: I promise you shes safe! No watch how much she loves this.\\nRachel: Ok.\\nRoss : Ready sweety?\\nRachel: Ok.\\nRoss: Here we go!\\nRachel: Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, shes smiling! Oh my God,    she does like it!\\nRoss: See, I told you!\\nRachel: Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, shes a little dare-devil!    Oh, let me push, can I push?\\nRoss: Oh, absolutely!\\nRachel: Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, its in the diaper bag.\\nRoss: Ok!  Ow!\\n\\nMike: Were seriously asking for our money back?\\nPhoebe: Its for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,    because one of us gonna have to start flirting.\\nCharity guy: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I dont    think that thats ever happened before.\\nPhoebe : Gay, go.\\nMike : Oh my God, I love your shirt!\\nPhoebe: The donation we made earlier, we k, we w, we want it    back.\\nCharity guy: Excuse me?\\nPhoebe: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didnt    want, but it turns out we do.\\nCharity guy: So youre asking us to refund your donation to the children?\\nMike: Yeah! This feels really good.\\nPhoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.\\nCharity guy: Hey, its not my business,  besides its probably a good thing. We really would have been    spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing\\nPhoebe: Hey, thats not fair! A persons wedding is important!    And especially to me! Ok? I didnt have a graduation party! And I didnt    go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an    escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to kill me    or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty    little man make me feel badly about it.\\nMike: She could have been talking about either one of us.\\nLaura: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.\\nMonica: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.\\nLaura: Thank you!\\nMonica: Would you like something to drink?\\nLaura: Oh, water would be fine.\\nMonica: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. Were really excited    about getting this process started.\\nChandler: Oh, because we love kids. Love em to death.Well, not actually    to death, that\\'s just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...    as allowed by law.\\nLaura: Your place is just lovely.\\nMonica: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.\\nLaura: You know, I... I feel like I\\'ve been here before. Are any other couples    in the    building adopting?\\nMonica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby    before    them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.\\nChandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.\\nLaura: Oh...\\nChandler: What?\\nLaura: I just realized why I remember this place.\\nMonica: Really? What is it?\\nLaura: Oh, it\\'s nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building    and it    didn\\'t end very well.\\nMonica: Ohh... that wouldn\\'t by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?\\nLaura: Yes!\\nChandler: Of course it was!\\nLaura: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he    would call    me and he didn\\'t.\\nChandler: RAT BASTARD!\\nLaura: So you\\'re not friends with him?\\nMonica and Chandler: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,    no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!\\nLaura: Well, I\\'m sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning    on staying at    home with your child...\\nJoey:  OW!\\nLaura: What was that?\\nChandler: Oh, it\\'s just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He\\'s great    with    kids though.\\nRachel: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?\\nRoss: SON OF A BITCH!\\nRachel: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.    That is    the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.\\nRoss: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn\\'t the swing\\'s fault. It was my fault    and kind    of that  kids fault. Who is still laughing.    Nice.\\nRachel: Ross, c\\'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else    gets    hurt?\\nRoss: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,    okay? And    you\\'ll see that there\\'s nothing to be afraid of.\\nRachel:  I know what this is all about... You\\'ve    always been    jealous of my hair.\\nRoss: Look, I just think you\\'re an adult, okay? And you should get over your    silly    fears.\\nRachel: Alright fine. I\\'ll do it.\\nRoss: Good.\\nRachel: If you hold a spider.\\nRoss:  WHAT?    WHERE? WHERE?\\nRachel: IF you hold a spider.\\nRoss: I know.\\nJoey: Guys? Everything ok? It\\'s me, Joe...\\nChandler:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!\\nLaura: What\\'s going on?\\nChandler: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.\\nJoey: Guys!?\\nMonica: Keep on roaming Bert! We don\\'t want any crazy today!\\nJoey: What\\'s going on?\\nChandler: WE\\'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG\\'S FINE!!\\nJoey: Everything doesn\\'t sound fine!\\nLaura: Is he alright out there by himself?\\nChandler: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.\\nLaura: Bert and Ernie!\\nChandler:  You can\\'t make this stuff up!\\nMike: You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I\\'m    sorry about    that.\\nPhoebe:  Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.\\nMike: Well, hey, at least you\\'re getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really    deserve that.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up.  Just like the kids I took the money from.\\nMike: No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don\\'t make me go back there.\\nPhoebe: Look, I can\\'t have a wedding with this money now. It\\'s tainted.\\nMike: Alright, fine. We\\'ll give the money back.\\nPhoebe: And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn\\'t    shot    anyone in a really long time.\\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler\\'s. They are preparing    to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler    and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other.\\nLaura: Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child    in.\\nMonica: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the    furniture,    because, believe me, you won\\'t find any porn or cigarettes under there!\\nLaura: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything    I need    up to here...\\nMonica:  Why don\\'t I show you the baby\\'s room?\\nChandler: What the hell are you doing?\\nJoey: Well, you wouldn\\'t let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.\\nChandler: Well, we\\'re not.\\nJoey: But you called me \\'Bert\\'!? That\\'s our code word for danger!\\nChandler: We don\\'t have a code word.\\nJoey: We don\\'t? We really should. From now on, \\'Bert\\' will be our code word    for danger.\\nMonica: So that was the baby\\'s room.\\nMonica:  What room should we see next?\\nChandler: Any room that isn\\'t behind this couch!\\nMonica: .\\nJoey:  I did not care for that!\\nChandler:  You have to get out of here. You slept    with    our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so    she can\\'t    see you.\\nJoey: Ok, ok!\\nChandler: Ok!\\nChandler: What?\\nJoey: I forgot my bat.\\nLaura: Oh my God!\\nChandler: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And    we don\\'t want to buy your bat!\\nLaura: What are you doing here?\\nJoey:  Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!\\nLaura: Are you friends with him?\\nChandler: I can explain... Joey...\\nJoey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back    here. I can\\'t believe you never called me.\\nLaura: Excuse me?\\nJoey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don\\'t even remember my name. It\\'s Joey, by    the way. And don\\'t bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.\\nLaura: I gave you my number, you never called me.\\nJoey: No, no! Don\\'t try to turn this around on me, ok? I\\'m not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do.\\nLaura:  Well, I\\'m pretty sure I gave    you my number.\\nJoey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You\\'re a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn\\'t I call you?\\nLaura: I don\\'t know... Well, maybe I\\'m wrong... I\\'m sorry...\\nJoey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?\\nLaura: Joey, wait!\\nJoey:\\nLaura:  I\\'m sorry that you had to see that. I\\'m so embarrassed...\\nChandler: Oh, that\\'s really ok.\\nMonica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.\\nLaura: Boy, you people are nice... And I\\'ve got to say... I think you\\'re going    to make excellent parents.\\nJoey: LAURA!\\nPhoebe:  We\\'re back!\\nCharity guy: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you\\'re    looking for is an ATM.\\nMike: No, no, we\\'re here to give the money back.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, because you know what, it\\'s... it\\'s all about the children.\\nPhoebe: Although... it\\'s also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!\\nCharity guy: If I haven\\'t said so already sir,     congratulations!\\nMike:  Now... what do you think we should do?\\nCharity guy: You know what? It\\'s not your decision anymore.\\nMike: What?\\nCharity guy: On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.\\nPhoebe: But... but... but we\\'re giving you this!\\nCharity guy: Yeah... And I\\'m giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it    a contribution.\\nPhoebe:  Well, this is very generous!\\nCharity guy: Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful    life together.\\nMike: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come    back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.\\nCharity guy: Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.\\nPhoebe: Oh, is that you?\\nCharity guy: No!\\nMonica: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can\\'t wait to tell Chandler...    Ok, goodbye.\\nChandler: Wrong number?\\nMonica: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on    the waiting list.\\nChandler: That\\'s great!\\nMonica: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there\\'s    a baby waiting for us. Oh...\\nChandler: Hello...? Have you seen Joey\\'s bat?\\n   COMMERCIAL BREAK\\nRachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.\\nRoss:  Ok...\\nRachel: Ok...\\nRoss:  This feels perfectly normal. Ok,    get on the swing!\\nRachel:  Ok... O-k...\\nRachel:  Ok...\\nRachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!\\nRoss: See?\\nRachel: A-alright! I can do this.\\nRoss: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I\\'m actually getting used    to this little guy. I don\\'t really even feel him in here anymore.\\nRachel: That\\'s because he\\'s on your neck.\\nRoss: Well...

Well, why don\\'t you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you\\'ll be trying to top than you did last year. You\\'d be in competition... with yourself.\\nMonica: That\\'s my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!\\nChandler: Don\\'t let yourself get manipulated this way!\\nMonica: Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!\\nChandler: We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?\\nOPENING CREDITS\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.\\nMonica: You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?\\nPhoebe: You\\'re not making the pies yourself?\\nMonica: No, no, no, I don\\'t make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.\\nRachel: Did you at least win the contest?\\nMonica: 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.\\nRachel: Can\\'t wait!\\nMonica: This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year \"me\"!\\nPhoebe: Hey Rach.\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: What\\'s Emma doing today?\\nRachel: Well, let\\'s see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?\\nPhoebe: Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.\\nRachel: Oh my God! That\\'s the creepiest thing I\\'ve ever heard!\\nPhoebe: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she\\'s a real dog!\\nRachel: Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!\\nPhoebe:  Oh... okay.\\nRachel: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who\\'s cuter just for a trophy...\\nRachel: And a thousand dollars.\\nRachel: ...is something I\\'m very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what\\'s in the inside is important...\\nPhoebe: Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.\\nRachel: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?\\nPhoebe: Well, I was thinking...\\nRachel: Oh, take the clothes of Joey\\'s Cabbage Patch Kid.\\nPhoebe: Yeah!\\nMonica:  Did someone drop the baton again?\\nChandler: Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?\\nMonica:  I don\\'t get older. I just get better!\\nChandler: You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!\\nMonica: You don\\'t know that.\\nChandler: Somebody is gonna pick us.\\nMonica: Yeah, but we haven\\'t heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!\\nChandler: I\\'m telling ya! It\\'s gonna happen. Next year it\\'s gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he\\'s my favourite author!\\nMonica: Name one of his books.\\nChandler:  \"The Firm\"?\\nMonica: Ok, let\\'s see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...\\nChandler: You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.\\nMonica: Oh, Chandler, that\\'s sweet. But you don\\'t have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.\\nChandler: I\\'m serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".\\nMonica: Ok, let\\'s see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.\\nChandler: Tell me more.\\nMonica: Okay, I\\'m gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these\\nChandler: You obviously haven\\'t tasted my Palmolive potatoes!\\nRoss: Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!\\nJoey: Three tickets to today\\'s Rangers game!!\\nRoss: Dude, I wanted him to guess.\\nJoey: Oh.\\nChandler: Oh my God!\\nJoey: Yeah, they\\'re great seats too!\\nRoss: Guess where they are?\\nJoey: Center ice.\\nRoss: Did I do something to you?\\nChandler: Hmm, the game\\'s at one.\\nRoss: So?\\nChandler: Dinner is at four, we\\'ll never gonna make it back.\\nJoey: So we\\'ll leave before it\\'s over, we\\'ll be back in time.\\nChandler: You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.\\nJoey: Dude, two times that happened!\\nChandler: Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn\\'t wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn\\'t go!\\nRoss: He\\'s right, man.\\nJoey: Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.\\nChandler: Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!\\nJoey: That\\'s some gentle comedy, dude.\\nRoss: We\\'re still going at the game, right?\\nJoey: Yeah!\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nHost: This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nRachel: Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I\\'ve been watching this guy over there, I don\\'t think he came with a kid!\\nPhoebe: We can\\'t leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!\\nRachel: Phoebe, I think... It\\'s just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!\\nPhoebe: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared.  It\\'s okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.\\nRachel: Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it\\'s already three o\\'clock and they haven\\'t even gotten to Emma\\'s group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!\\nPhoebe:  But Emma\\'s got what it takes, she could go all the way!\\nRachel: Phoebe, you have to calm down.\\nPhoebe: Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!\\nRachel: Really?\\nPhoebe: Yeah!\\nRachel: You heard them say that?\\nPhoebe: Yeah!\\nRachel: All right, okay. Alright, let\\'s give to these babies something to cry about!\\nPhoebe: Good! Oh yay! Let\\'s get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!\\nRachel: No, what?\\nPhoebe: Well, she\\'s gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!\\nRachel: No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!\\nPhoebe: Why not!\\nRachel: Because I already did!\\nJoey: Oh, Bob, get off the guy!\\nRoss: Oh! What a game, huh?\\nJoey: I know, yeah.\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe Chandler is missing this!\\nJoey: Yeah. I am sorry he\\'s not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.\\nRoss: Yeah, I\\'d probably enjoy it more if you didn\\'t keep batting my hand away.\\nJoey: Ohhhh! These seats are great!\\nRoss: I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn\\'t read my banner!\\nJoey:  Wow, hey, we\\'d better get going. If we don\\'t leave right now, we\\'ll be late for dinner.\\nRoss: Oh, but it\\'s a kind game! So we\\'re a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let\\'s stay just for one more goal.\\nJoey: I don\\'t know...\\nRoss: One more fight!\\nJoey: Okay.\\nRoss: Okay.\\nMonica: Where is everybody? They\\'re forty-five minutes late!\\nChandler: I can\\'t believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They\\'ve ruined cranberry day!\\nJoey: How late are we?\\nRoss: Forty-five minutes.\\nJoey: Wow\\nRoss:  Here!\\nJoey: Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!\\nRoss: You may want to lose the foam finger!\\nJoey: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Oh!\\nJoey: You are not at Thanksgiving?\\nRachel: No...\\nPhoebe: No, we\\'re late!\\nRachel: What are you doing here!\\nRoss: We\\'re late too!\\nJoey: We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time\\nPhoebe: Don\\'t point that thing at me, Tribbiani!\\nRoss: So, nobody\\'s here? Monica\\'s gonna kill us!\\nJoey: Yeah, where were you!\\nRoss: Yeah, yeah, what\\'s with the trophy!\\nPhoebe: Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!\\nRachel: And I won!\\nRoss: You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.\\nRachel: Yes!  Y-E-S. Yes!\\nRoss: Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.\\nRachel: Yeah. That\\'s me!\\nRoss: You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?\\nPhoebe: And it looks like she put makeup on her!\\nJoey: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe this, she\\'s our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!\\nRachel: She won a thousand dollars!\\nRoss: So this is an annual thing?\\nJoey:  Oh! That\\'s Alicia Mae Emory\\'s outfit!\\nPhoebe: You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!\\nRoss: Yeah. What are we gonna do?\\nRachel: Well, I don\\'t know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.\\nJoey: All right. Hey Rach, while you\\'re in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.\\nPhoebe: Alright, what are we gonna say?\\nRoss: Ooh, we\\'ll say that we were mugged! You can\\'t get mad at someone who\\'s been mugged!\\nPhoebe: Oh, good, that\\'s good, but you don\\'t look like you were mugged!\\nJoey: No. Here\\nRoss:  HEY!\\nMonica: Do you hear something?\\nChandler:  They\\'re out there!\\nMonica: Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can\\'t believe this! They\\'re an hour late and they\\'re just staying out there, talking!\\nChandler:  Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says \"Rangers\" on it. They went to the game!\\nMonica:  Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!\\nChandler:  Ross\\' shirt is torn.\\nMonica: Oh! They\\'re late and they\\'re sloppy!\\nRachel: Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?\\nRoss: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.\\nPhoebe: We\\'re just... we\\'re trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o\\'clock, not 4 o\\'clock. That way we\\'re right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.\\nRoss:  That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.\\nRachel: You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o\\'clock. We\\'ll just act casual. We\\'re not late, we\\'re right on time.\\nRoss:\\nJoey:  Who do you think its from?\\nRachel: Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.\\nRoss: Well, let\\'s just go in there and face them.\\nPhoebe: Well, I\\'m not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica\\'s forehead is popping like crazy.\\nJoey: I hate that thing, it\\'s like a... bolt of lightning.\\nRachel: Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don\\'t we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. .\\nJoey:  Ah-haah! I win!!\\nRoss: What is that?\\nJoey: That\\'s fire. Beats everything.\\nPhoebe: Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .\\nJoey: Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.\\nRachel: Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let\\'s just all go in at the same time.\\nAll: Alright, okay.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s locked.\\nRoss: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they\\'re having sex on the couch, its like: \"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy\".\\nRachel: Alright, come on...  Alright, you guys. We\\'re so sorry we\\'re late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.\\nMonica: No! Everything\\'s cold. The turkey\\'s dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.\\nChandler: Yeah, and there\\'s a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?\\nMonica:  Nothing. It\\'s fine.\\nChandler:  Oh thank God!\\nRoss: Come on you guys, we\\'re sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.\\nChandler:  That\\'s a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey\\'s hand.\\nRoss:\\nRachel: You guys, come on, it doesn\\'t matter why we\\'re late. We\\'re all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.\\nJoey: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.\\nMonica: That\\'s all the turkey you\\'re gonna get.\\nRoss: How are we gonna decide who gets this?\\nJoey:\\nPhoebe: What are we gonna do? I\\'m starving.\\nRachel:  Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah!\\nMonica: Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.\\nChandler: Guys, I\\'d listen to her. The vein is bigger than I\\'ve ever seen it.\\nRachel: Huh... OH MY GOD IT\\'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.\\nRoss: That\\'s worse than no food.\\nChandler: HA-HA! All you got was Monica\\'s stinky Brussels sprouts!\\nMonica: Stinky?!\\nChandler: Please let me stay on this side of the door.\\nRachel: Oh, I know... I still have my old key!  We can just unlock the door.\\nPhoebe: Well, I don\\'t know if that\\'s such a good idea. They clearly don\\'t want to be with us.\\nRachel: You know what? I don\\'t want to be with them either, but it\\'s Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.\\nJoey:  Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.\\nRoss: I don\\'t know...\\nJoey: I\\'m telling ya...  I can do it.\\nRoss:  Yeah, he can do it!\\nRachel: Oh!\\nJoey: Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...\\nChandler: The cranberries...?\\nMonica: Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made \\'em!\\nJoey:  Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.\\nChandler: He\\'s doing that weird eye contact thing. Don\\'t look at him, don\\'t look at him!\\nJoey: Come on you guys, we want you to know we\\'re  Right guys?\\nRoss: I feel terrible.\\nPhoebe and Rachel: So, so sorry.\\nJoey:  Now let\\'s not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let\\'s move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?\\nChandler: The floating heads do make a good point.\\nMonica: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.\\nRachel: So bad.\\nRoss : So bad.\\nPhoebe: So bad.\\nMonica:  go get the dessert. And I\\'ll let you in.\\nRachel: Dessert?\\nMonica: Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?\\nPhoebe: Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize .\\nMonica: Grand Supreme Little Darling?\\nRachel: Congratulatioooons!\\nMonica: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you\\'re an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.\\nRoss: Really girls, not cool.\\nChandler: Well, you manheads aren\\'t any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.\\nJoey: Hey! I\\'m getting a little tired of this okay? We said we\\'re sorry. It\\'s Thanksgiving for Pete\\'s sakes! A day of forgiveness!\\nRoss: It\\'s a day to be thankful.\\nJoey:  Don\\'t make me come up there!\\nMonica: It\\'s too late for apologies.\\nJoey: Fine! Let\\'s just go. I don\\'t need your stupid dinner.\\nChandler: That would be a lot more convincing if you weren\\'t drooling.\\nRachel: Ewww, is that what that is?\\nJoey: Sorry!\\nPhoebe: Come on you guys, let\\'s just do our own Thanksgiving.\\nRachel: Yeah! I\\'ll cook!\\nRoss: Yeah! Let\\'s go out.\\nRachel: Hey!\\nJoey: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.\\nMonica: The three of us?\\nJoey: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!\\nJoey: Ha!\\nJoey: Oh-oh! I\\'m stuck!\\nMonica: Joey, that is not gonna work.\\nJoey: No seriously... I\\'m really wedged in here.\\nPhoebe: I\\'ll pull you through.\\nRoss: Okay.\\nJoey:  aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I\\'m worried about damaging my head.\\nChandler: A little late for that.\\nJoey: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.\\nMonica: Alright, well, this does not change anything.  Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.\\nChandler: Uhm, we\\'ve got turkey grease.\\nMonica: Bring it.\\nJoey: I just wanna say that I\\'m sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...\\nMonica: Here you go!\\nJoey: Oh, that smells good!\\nJoey: Okay.\\nMonica: Okay, try it.\\nJoey: It isn\\'t working.\\nMonica: Alright, we\\'re gonna have to unscrew the chain.\\nJoey: Well hurry, I can\\'t feel my ears!\\nChandler: Can you ever feel your ears?\\nJoey: Interesting...\\nMonica: Chandler, where are your tools?\\nChandler:  Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don\\'t have tools!\\nMonica: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.\\nRachel: I lent them to Ross.\\nRoss: I gave them to Joey.\\nJoey: I left them at the park.\\nMonica: Oh!\\nRoss:  I\\'m finding it really hard not to mess with him.\\nPhoebe: I\\'ve already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.\\nRoss: Nice!\\nMonica: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.\\nJoey: It\\'s really starting to hurt.\\nChandler: Okay, look, I\\'m gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!\\nPhoebe: Just a sec., we\\'re kind in the middle of something here.\\nJoey: Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!\\nChandler: Come on guys, PUSH!\\nJoey: Yeah! Come on!\\nJoey and Chandler: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!\\nChandler: My cranberries!\\nJoey:  Man, I\\'ve got food all over me.\\nChandler: Argh! I can\\'t believe what you did. Monica\\'s gonna kill you!\\nChandler:  Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!\\nMonica:  I don\\'t care.\\nChandler: What\\'s going on?\\nMonica: That was the adoption agency...\\nChandler: And?\\nMonica: WE\\'RE GETTING A BABY!\\nChandler: Are you serious?\\nMonica: There\\'s a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!\\nRachel: I\\'m so happy for you!\\nMonica: This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving\\'s ass!\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nRachel: To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.\\nRoss: I\\'m just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.\\nPhoebe: I know. Have you considered pageanting?\\nMonica: I can\\'t believe they called, and we\\'re actually getting a baby.\\nJoey: Oh, I know how you feel...\\nRachel: Really?\\nJoey: Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys \"R\" Us... She was in stock!\\nChandler: That is the exact same thing.\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-09\\nWritten by: Scott Silveri    Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller    Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa    Final check by Kim\\n    Chandler:  Hi!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey!\\nChandler: We\\'re just here to say goodbye, we\\'re off to Ohio.\\nPhoebe: Oh, right!

She liked our application but who knows if she\\'s gonna like us.\\nRoss: Come on, she\\'s gonna love you guys!\\nChandler: Uhm, thank you, but we\\'re really trying not to get our hopes up.\\nMonica: And a lot could still get in our way.\\nChandler: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..\\nPhoebe: What are you gonna name the baby?\\nChandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.\\nJoey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?\\nMonica: Oh my God. She\\'s gonna pick us!\\nChandler: So we\\'re standing firm on the \\'not getting our hopes up\\'?\\nMonica: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don\\'t?

But on top of it, you\\'re married to a reverend?\\nChandler:  I don\\'t think that\\'s exactly...\\nMonica:  Let her finish, doctor.\\n    Phoebe: Hey!\\nJoey: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.\\nJoey: Well...\\nPhoebe: Yeah!

Emma!\\nJoey:  JOEY DOESNT SHARE FOOD!\\nPhoebe: Well, I still think that its a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her!

Please, just wear what I suggest, and shes gonna go nuts for you.\\nRoss: So, youre saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?\\nRachel:  Why do men keep talking to me like this?\\n\\nChandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wifes a reverend, thats important to you?\\nErica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought who better then a minister to raise a child!\\nMonica: Amen.\\nChandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!\\nMonica: Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.\\nErica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?\\nMonica: It says Do it!. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.\\nErica: Wow.\\nChandler: Yeah, wow.\\nErica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?\\nMonica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.\\nErica:  Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.\\nChandler: No-ot for me it doesnt.\\nAgency guy: So, hows everything going in here?\\nErica: Were great, I think I may have asked all my questions.\\nAgency guy: Do you have any question for Erica?\\nChandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?\\nAgency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. Were very proud of it.\\nChandler: You should be. Youre really on top of stuff..\\nAgency guy:  Well, then if theres nothing else, then the two of us should talk.\\nErica: Actually, I dont think we have to.\\nMonica: We dont?\\nErica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I\\'ve made my decision. I choose them.\\nMonica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?\\nChandler: Yeah, I did.\\nMonica: . You are SO going to Heaven!\\n    Rachel: We got some really great stuff!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra\\'s I got.\\nRachel: Oh! Really?

Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I\\'m glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.\\nJoey:  Dude, I really don\\'t think you should be wearing that.\\nRoss: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?\\nJoey:  Looks like someone IS the ladies!!\\nRoss: You\\'re just jealous because you couldn\\'t pull this off. Yeah, now if you\\'ll excuse me  ALL eyes on ME!\\n\\nChandler: We are NOT signing those papers.\\nMonica: Why not?\\nChandler: It\\'s wrong. They made a mistake. They think we\\'re somebody else.\\nMonica: God works in mysterious ways.\\nChandler: You have gotta stop!\\nMonica: But she liked us.\\nChandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.\\nMonica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.\\nChandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95!\\nMonica: C\\'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.\\nChandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?\\nMonica:  Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.\\nChandler: I know..\\nMonica: I mean, who knows how long it\\'s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?\\nChandler: oh, honey..\\nMonica:  Please.. please, we are so close.\\nChandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it\\'s going to.         Monica:\\nChandler: So, we\\'ll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she\\'ll like us for us.\\nMonica:  Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn\\'t I have been a Reverend?\\nChandler: You\\'re Jewish.\\nMonica: Technicality!\\nWaiter: A garden salad for the lady\\nJoey: Oh, that looks great!

Coule?\\nSarah:  No. If I can\\'t have your clams, you can\\'t have my dessert. This is a two way street.\\nJoey:  Really?\\nSarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.\\nJoey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself.\\nJoey:  Stop staring at me!\\nJoey: Why, just a tiny little...\\nJoey: Oh-oh!\\nTIME LAPSE\\nJoey: I\\'m not even sorry.\\nErica: Hi!\\nAdoption Agency guy: Hey.\\nChandler: Hey.\\nAgency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There\\'s a lot to go over, but I\\'ll explain everything as we go through it.\\nMonica:  I-Is... Is that a picture?\\nErica: Yeah. It\\'s a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.\\nMonica: Look, doctor!\\nAgency guy: I don\\'t understand.\\nChandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I\\'m not a doctor.\\nErica: What?\\nAgency guy: That\\'s impossible.\\nChandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you\\'d like.\\nAgency guy: I\\'ll go check your file. Excuse me.\\nErica: So who are you?\\nChandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We\\'re from New York.\\nMonica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.\\nErica: So you lied to me before?\\nMonica: Well, we...  \"bore false witness\"... See I could be a reverend.\\nErica: I can\\'t believe this.\\nMonica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...\\nErica: Giving you my baby? You think I\\'d give you my child after this?\\nMonica: Well, you don\\'t have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...\\nErica: I don\\'t want to look at your file! This is over.\\nChandler: Erica wait!\\nErica: I\\'ve nothing to say to you.\\nChandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we\\'ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don\\'t know how long it\\'s gonna be before we can get another chance again.\\nErica: Why don\\'t you ask the reverend to pray on it?\\nChandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name\\'s Bing. My wife\\'s a chef and I\\'m in advertising.\\nErica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn\\'t matter, because what you did was wrong.\\nChandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife\\'s an incredible woman. She\\'s loving and devoted and caring. And don\\'t tell her I said this but the woman\\'s always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can\\'t give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I\\'ll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she\\'s already there. She\\'s a mother... without a baby... Please?\\nChandler: You still want that baby?\\nMonica: God bless you Chandler Bing!\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nRoss: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.\\nJoey:  So, why are you still wearing it?\\nRoss: Because it\\'s soft... Hey, so how was your date?\\nJoey: Ooh... Not so good.\\nRoss: Well, looks like it\\'s just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?\\nJoey: Yeah, and you know what?

I know this isn\\'t exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\\nAll: That\\'s so sweet.\\nRoss: And hey, here\\'s to a lousy Christmas.\\nRachel: And a crappy New Year.\\nChandler: Here, here!\\nRachel: You can\\'t move.

Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.\\nChandler: Totally. I had sex in High school...\\nRoss: Me too. I\\'m good at it.\\nChandler: All right, I\\'d say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.\\nRoss: You got it.\\nChandler: All right, so that\\'s Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.\\nRoss: Those are the pacts!\\nChandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn\\'t get her anyway.\\nRoss: Oh, oh... maybe not you!\\nChandler: Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.\\nRoss: Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?\\nChandler: Your hands are shaking.\\nRoss: I know, and I can\\'t stop sweating.\\nVoice: Five! Four! Three!

Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn\\'t want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!\\nMissy: Really?\\nRoss: Yeah, why?\\nMissy: Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!\\nRoss: You did?\\nMissy: Yeah. We\\'d go to the science lab after hours!\\nRoss:  AND ON MY TURF?\\nMonica:  Hey, where is this guy, it\\'s been over an hour!\\nRachel: Well, he\\'s coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!\\nMonica: Who is it?\\nMan: It\\'s the police!\\nRachel:  Uh!

Here? All right.\\nPhoebe: Rachel?\\nRachel: Yeah?\\nPhoebe: Are you kidding?\\nRachel: All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!\\nPhoebe: How old is your phonebook?\\nMonica: Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!\\nPhoebe: Oh God no, I don\\'t wanna see him take his clothes off!\\nRoy: Are you talking about me?\\nMonica: Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!\\nRoy: Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please?  I hope you\\'re familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!\\nRoy: Whoa, whoa, whoa .

Look, I\\'ve been in this business for a long time!\\nPhoebe: Shocking!\\nRoy: Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I\\'ll be on my way!\\nPhoebe: Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?\\nRachel: No, that\\'s ok, let\\'s me just get my check book!\\nPhoebe: No, you\\'re not gonna pay him, he didn\\'t do anything!\\nRoy: Didn\\'t do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It\\'s not like I can take them two at a time!\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t care. We\\'re not paying you 300 dollars for this.\\nRoy: Well, look - it\\'s not my fault if you\\'re too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it\\'s glory.\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, okay. I\\'m uptight. Yeah, that\\'s why I don\\'t want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!\\nRoy: I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what\\'s underneath ... is all man.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry, did you say all man or old man?\\nRoy:  Oh, you\\'re mean!\\nMonica:  Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...\\nRoy: Damnit.

Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.\\nHenrietta: Uvula!\\nJoey: Oh, then pass.\\nDonny: O-kay... Henrietta, you didn\\'t get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars!\\nRoss:  You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?\\nChandler: . That didn\\'t make us sound gay at all!\\nRoss: You broke the pact!\\nChandler: Ross, that was 16 years ago!\\nRoss: That doesn\\'t matter! We\\'re talking about the foundation of our friendship.\\nChandler: I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we\\'re really gonna do this... it\\'s not like you never broke one of the pacts.\\nRoss: I didn\\'t.\\nChandler: Oh really?\\nRoss: No.\\nChandler: Oh really!?\\nRoss: NO!\\nChandler: ADRIENNE TURNER!!\\nAdrienne: Yes?\\nChandler and Ross: Hey! Hey Adrienne.\\nRoss: I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.\\nChandler: Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.\\nRoss: I don\\'t know what... you\\'re talking about.\\nChandler: Really?\\n Present Chandler\\'s voice: Remember that big party?

We\\'ll be here for days.\\nRoss: Listen Adrienne, you can\\'t tell Chandler about this.\\nAdrienne: Oh believe me, Ross, I won\\'t be telling anybody about this.\\nRoss: Cool!\\nRoss: I didn\\'t know you knew about that.\\nChandler: Well, I did and it hurt.  That\\'s when I wrote the song: \"Betrayal In The Common Room\".\\nRoss:  Man... I... I\\'m sorry.\\nChandler: Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.\\nRoss: So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we\\'re even.\\nChandler:  Hmm mmmhm..\\nRoss: We are even, right?\\nChandler:  Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?\\nRoss:  What did you do to my mom?\\nChandler: Not her!\\nRachel: I am sooo drunk.\\nMonica: That\\'s weird. I\\'ve had the same number of beers as you and I don\\'t feel anything at all.\\nChandler: Soo... you girls having fun?\\nMonica: For your information, ass munch, I\\'ve lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.\\nPizza guy: SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?\\nMonica: Oh THATS ME!\\nRachel:  I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.\\nChandler: Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.\\nRachel:  Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don\\'t I just start taking my smart pills now?\\nChandler: Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.\\nRachel:\\nChandler: So where are you applying to?\\nRachel: Oh well, You know, I think it\\'s kinda really important that I go somewhere where there\\'s sun, so I\\'m sort of...  Hey!\\nChandler: I\\'m in college and I\\'m in a band.\\nRachel:\\n\\nRoy: What\\'s the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?\\nPhoebe: You know, it\\'s fine. We\\'ll pay you.\\nRoy: No, no, you\\'re right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.\\nRachel: No, wait. No there\\'s gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?\\nRoy: I don\\'t know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.\\nRachel: So maybe something in an office.\\nPhoebe: Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.\\nRoy: You know, actually that\\'s not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don\\'t think my mom would mind.\\nPhoebe: There you go. Okay, do you think you\\'re gonna be okay?\\nRoy: Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it\\'s gonna be your last dance. And I didn\\'t even get a chance to finish it.\\nPhoebe:  Finish it!\\nRoy: What?\\nPhoebe: Your last dance. Do it for us.\\nRoy: Really?\\nRachel:  Really?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.\\nRoy: Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!\\nPhoebe: Oh this is so ho-o-ot!\\nPhoebe: Oh no, no, no, don\\'t stop!\\nRoy:  Have to...\\n\\nDonny: Well, welcome to the Winner Circle.

When was this?\\nRoss: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.\\nMonica: Oh my God! That\\'s wild!\\nChandler: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn\\'t matter.\\nRoss: Well, it matters to me.\\nChandler: Why?\\nRoss: Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.\\nChandler: You kissed her that night too?\\nMonica: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.\\nChandler: Seriously, where did this happen?\\nRoss: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.\\nChandler: Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?\\nRoss: Mine.\\nChandler: I\\'m pretty sure I put her on my bed.\\nRoss: No, she was definitely on my bed.\\nChandler: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?\\nRoss: Well, then who was on my bed?\\nMonica:\\nRoss:  NO! No, no!\\nMonica: YES!\\nRoss: You were under the pile of coats?\\nMonica: I was the pile of coats!\\nRoss: OH MY GOD!\\nMonica: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?\\nRoss: You were my first kiss with Rachel?\\nMonica: You were my first kiss ever?\\nChandler: What did I marry into?\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nMonica: Oh, crap!\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-12\\nWritten by: Robert Carlock & Dana Klein     Produced by: Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller     Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa\\nPhoebe: Oh, hey Joey.\\nJoey: Uh, hey.\\nPhoebe: Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad\\'s in prison.\\nJoey:  Yeah.\\nPhoebe: Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he\\'d come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn\\'t wait till Monday.\\nJoey: So he can\\'t come?\\nPhoebe: No, and so there\\'s no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.\\nJoey: Seriously?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you\\'ve... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you\\'ve always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...\\nJoey: I am pretty wisdomous.\\nPhoebe: So... what do you say?\\nJoey: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.\\nPhoebe: Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.\\nJoey:  I don\\'t want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!\\nOPENING CREDITS\\n     Phoebe: Oh.\\nJoey: Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.\\nPhoebe:  Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way.

All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.\\nPhoebe: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.\\nMonica: You don\\'t know military time?\\nPhoebe: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.\\nMonica: Just subtract twelve.\\nPhoebe: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...\\nMonica:  Six o\\'clock!\\nPhoebe: Ok.\\nMonica: Ok. Hold on.  Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?\\nPhoebe: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.\\nMonica: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.\\nPhoebe: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.\\nMonica: Ooh... she backed out.\\nPhoebe: She did? Why?\\nMonica: I made her.  Steel drums don\\'t really say \"elegant wedding\". Nor does Marjorie\\'s overwhelming scent.\\nPhoebe:  Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.\\nChandler: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nChandler: You look great. I\\'m so glad we\\'re having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.\\nPhoebe: Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?\\nChandler: No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.\\nPhoebe: Rehearse it!\\nRoss: Hi!\\nMike: Thanks for coming you guys.\\nRoss: Oh,  hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.\\nMike: Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?\\nRoss: That is why!\\nMike: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: So Rach.\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: Where is Emma?\\nRachel: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother\\'s.

But I\\'m just trying to be nice for the kids!\\nChandler:  You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we\\'re doing in the wedding tomorrow.\\nRoss: Yeah, I thought we\\'d be groomsmen, but wouldn\\'t they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?\\nRachel: Uh... November?\\nRoss: I wanna say it\\'s not looking good.\\nRachel: Hey Pheebs...\\nPhoebe: What\\'s up?\\nRachel: Uhm... you haven\\'t told these guys what they\\'re doing in the wedding yet.\\nChandler: Heh.\\nPhoebe: Uhm... well, they\\'re not in the wedding.\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Well, this is really awkward  Oh, and I can leave!\\nPhoebe: I\\'m sorry you guys but, you know, Mike\\'s got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.\\nRoss: Oh, man!\\nChandler: This is like figure skating team all over again.  Help me!\\nRoss: FOOTBALL!\\nChandler: Thank you.\\nMonica:  Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.\\nPhoebe: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!\\nMonica: Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t have a fax machine.\\nMonica: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe we\\'re gonna be the only people that aren\\'t in this wedding.\\nChandler: I know, I hate being left out of things.\\nRoss: And it\\'s a wedding! It\\'d be weird if I\\'m not in it...\\nMike: Hey guys, how is it going?\\nChandler: Fine. We\\'re just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It\\'s our rehearsal for tomorrow.\\nMike: Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I\\'ve got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can\\'t make it.\\nChandler: What happened?\\nRoss: Who cares, AND?\\nMike: ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...\\nRoss: I\\'ll do it!\\nChandler:  M-Me-me-me!\\nMike: You both wanna do it? Uhm... there\\'s only room for one.\\nChandler: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.\\nRoss: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?\\nMike: You know, I really don\\'t feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I\\'m gonna let her choose.\\nRoss:  Well, if Phoebe\\'s choosing, then say hello to Mike\\'s next groomsman.\\nChandler: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!\\nRoss: Please, you\\'re going down!\\nChandler: You are going downer!\\nRoss: Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?\\nChandler:\\nJoey: So, you know I\\'m filling in for Phoebe\\'s step dad, tomorrow, right?\\nMike: Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.\\nJoey: Oh, hey, my pleasure.  So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?\\nMike: I intend to marry her.\\nJoey: Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn\\'t that kind of unstable?\\nMike: No more so than acting.\\nJoey: Strike two!\\nMike: You\\'re right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?\\nJoey: Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!\\nRoss: So, what did you decide?\\nPhoebe: I decided to pee.\\nChandler: Mike didn\\'t tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.\\nPhoebe: Oh no, no. I can\\'t choose between you two! I love you both so much!\\nChandler: Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.\\nPhoebe: Oh, I don\\'t wanna choose! It\\'s . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.\\nRachel:  Goody, what is it!\\nPhoebe: Well, there\\'s a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.\\nRachel: What, what, what, no, I don\\'t wanna do that.\\nPhoebe: All right, I guess I\\'ll have to find a new bridesmaid.\\nRoss: I\\'ll do it!\\nMonica: Ok, it\\'s 2100 hours.\\nMike: Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?\\nMonica: You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!\\nMike: Is that what you say to Chandler?\\nMonica:\\nPhoebe: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow\\'s the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn\\'t get off to the best start.  but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn\\'t be here...\\nMonica : oh God.\\nPhoebe: And... moment\\'s over!  You know what? You\\'re done.\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: YOU\\'RE FIRED!\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nRachel: Happy wedding day!\\nPhoebe: Oh, happy my wedding day to you!\\nRachel: Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We\\'re gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.\\nJoey: Oh, man! I wouldn\\'t have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!\\nMonica: Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I\\'m willing to take my job back.\\nPhoebe: Oh, well that\\'s ok. I think you and I will do much better if you\\'re just... here as a bridesmaid.\\nMonica: Oh, is that so? Ok. If that\\'s really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don\\'t really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you\\'re taking over, you should probably return these messages.\\nPhoebe: Wow, this is a lot!\\nMonica: Uh-huh, but I\\'m sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I\\'m sure you\\'ll do fine.\\nPhoebe: You won awards?\\nMonica: Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.\\nRoss: Hey!\\nMonica: Hi.\\nRoss: Where\\'s Rach?\\nMonica: She\\'s in her room, why?\\nRoss: I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I\\'m not gonna watch Chandler up there while I\\'m sitting in the seats like some chump!  Oh! My God! You\\'re breathtaking!\\nRachel: What d\\'you want?\\nRoss: You haven\\'t by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?\\nRachel: Oh, Ross, c\\'mon, please! Don\\'t make this harder than it already is!\\nRoss: I\\'m not! I\\'m making it easier! Pick me!\\nRachel: Well, Chandler said that it\\'s really important to him too!\\nRoss: Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won\\'t say a word, but if you pick Chandler he\\'s gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!\\nRachel: Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!\\nRoss:  YES, YES!\\nPhoebe: Sven I don\\'t understand what you\\'re saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?\\nMonica: I know.\\nMike: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word \"lorkins\" what flowers would that be?\\nMike:  Orchids?\\nPhoebe: Right there! That\\'s why I\\'m marrying you!\\nJoey:  Hello Michael.\\nMike: Joseph.\\nJoey: May I have a word with you, please?\\nMike:  This is... great...\\nJoey: Have a seat.  I cannot allow this.\\nMike:  Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?\\nJoey: More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for \"Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.\"\\nMike: Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?\\nJoey: I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.\\nMike:  Joe, I love Phoebe. She\\'s the single most important thing in my life. I\\'d die before I let anything happen to her.\\nJoey:  That\\'s what I wanted to hear! Because she\\'s family, ok, and now you\\'re gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.\\nMike: That must have been one lousy movie.\\nJoey:  That was ME!\\nRachel: Hi\\nChandler: Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he\\'ll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you\\'ll be getting some comedy!\\nRachel: Even so, I think I\\'m gonna pick Ross.\\nChandler: Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn\\'t even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I\\'m the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.\\nRachel: All right fine, I pick you.\\nChandler:  Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make \"groom\" for Chandler.\\nRachel:  Oh my...\\nPhoebe: No! We\\'re gonna do it my way.  Hello?\\nJoey: I\\'m glad we had this little talk.\\nMike: Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice.  That didn\\'t make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I\\'ll see everybody tonight?\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nMonica: Bye.\\nMike: Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?\\nPhoebe: Oh my God, what\\'s it doing here?\\nMonica:  Uh! What a pickle.\\nPhoebe:  Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?\\nJoey:\\nChandler: How\\'s it going?\\nRoss:  Good. I\\'m just getting some coffee. So I\\'m alert for the wedding.\\nChandler:  That\\'s what I was doing too.\\nRoss:  Well, you have fun tonight.\\nChandler: You too.\\nRoss: Oh, I will.\\nChandler: Me too.\\nRoss: Wait a minute, I know why I\\'m being such an ass, why are you?\\nChandler: I\\'m not supposed to tell you.\\nRoss: I\\'m not supposed to tell you!\\nChandler: You told us both we could be in the wedding?\\nRachel: Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.\\nRoss: Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.\\nChandler: Rach, Rach, knock knock.\\nRachel: Who\\'s there?\\nChandler: I\\'ll tell you at the wedding.\\nRachel: Uh.\\nMike: Hey, I forgot my scarf.\\nRachel: You know what, I can\\'t do this. I don\\'t know which one of you guys to pick.\\nMike: Oh, you haven\\'t picked yet. Oh good, \\'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.\\nRoss: What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.\\nRachel:  Wow, this is a tough one. I think I\\'m gonna have to go with the dog.\\nPhoebe: Alright, wait, so what you\\'re saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?\\nMonica:  How\\'s it going?\\nPhoebe:  Help me.\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.\\nMonica:  Really?\\nPhoebe:  Please?\\nMonica: You really want me to come back?\\nPhoebe: More than I wanna get married.\\nMonica: Ok people, we are back in business!  Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I\\'ll take care of everything.\\nJoey: Hey, what are you guys gonna do?\\nPhoebe:  About what?\\nJoey: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it\\'s like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.\\nMonica: Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!\\nJoey: I don\\'t think they are.\\nRoss:  So sorry Pheebs.\\nMonica:  Well, the club lost it\\'s power.\\nJoey: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.\\nRachel: Since when do you watch the news?\\nJoey: Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.\\nRoss:  I can\\'t believe you guys aren\\'t going to be able to get married today.\\nPhoebe: I know.\\nRachel: Wow, you know, it\\'s so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don\\'t you guys just do it on the street?\\nPhoebe: What?\\nRachel: Well, look, it\\'s hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn\\'t ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you\\'ve always wanted!\\nPhoebe:  What do you think?\\nMike: I think I wanna get married to you today.\\nPhoebe: Me too!  Monica, do you think we could do it?\\nMonica:  AFFIRMATIVE!\\nMonica:\\nMike\\'s mom: Michael!\\nMike: Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi!  Mom, I know getting married in the street isn\\'t something you approve of...\\nMike\\'s mom: No... It\\'s lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.\\nMike\\'s dad:  Come on, sweetheart.\\nMike:  You know, Chappy\\'s too small to handle all this snow. Someone\\'s gonna have to walk him down the aisle.\\nChandler: So technically, would this person be in the wedding?\\nMike: I guess.\\nChandler and Ross: I\\'ll do it!\\nRoss: No, but Chandler, hello... Aren\\'t you scared of dogs?\\nChandler: I\\'m not scared.  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.\\nRoss:  He stinks!\\nMonica: Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we\\'ve got a situation. The minister just called. He\\'s snowed in. He can\\'t make it.\\nMike: Oh, no!\\nJoey: Oh hey, don\\'t worry. I\\'m still ordained from your wedding.\\nMonica: Really?\\nJoey: Yeah, you\\'d think I\\'d give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...\\nRoss: Uhm, ministers don\\'t ride the subway for free.\\nJoey: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.\\nMonica: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.\\nChandler:  I\\'ll do it.\\nRoss: I\\'ll...\\nChandler:  Ah ah...\\nMonica: Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.\\nMonica: Okay, Joey\\'s doing the ceremony and Chandler\\'s giving you away.\\nPhoebe: Oh, okay. Hi new dad.\\nMonica: So, you\\'re ready to do this?\\nPhoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.\\nRachel: Oh Phoebe, I\\'m so happy for you honey.\\nPhoebe: Oh, thank you.\\nMonica: I love you.\\nPhoebe: I love you guys.\\nRachel and Monica: I love you.\\nMonica: Okay.  Let\\'s get this bad boy on the road.\\nChandler:  Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?\\nMonica:  I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.\\nChandler: Oh yeah!\\nMonica: Okay Marjorie, hit it.\\nRachel: Geez Ross, you could have showered.\\nRoss: It\\'s the dog.\\nMonica: Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that\\'s me.\\nChandler: Ready?\\nPhoebe:  Okay.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nPhoebe: Oh wait, oh no. Wait.\\nChandler: Wow! Aren\\'t you gonna be cold?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t care... I\\'ll be my something blue.\\nChandler: You look beautiful.\\nPhoebe: Thank you.\\nMike: My God! Aren\\'t you freezing?\\nPhoebe: Na-ah.\\nJoey: Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I\\'m gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?\\nJoey:  Okay...\\nPhoebe: When I was growing up, I didn\\'t have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I\\'m standing here today, knowing that I have everything I\\'m ever gonna need... You are my family.\\nMike: Phoebe you\\'re so beautiful. You\\'re so kind, you\\'re so generous. You\\'re so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can\\'t believe how lucky I am, and I can\\'t wait to share my life with you forever.\\nPhoebe: Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.\\nMike: I love you too.\\nRoss: Uh Joey...\\nJoey: Yeah?\\nRoss: Chappy\\'s heart rate has slowed way down.\\nJoey: Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?\\nPhoebe: I do.\\nJoey: Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?\\nMike: I do.\\nJoey: I now pronounce you... husband and wife.\\nPhoebe: I got married!  Could someone get me a coat, I\\'m freaking freezing.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nChandler: That really was an incredible wedding.\\nJoey: It was, yeah. I kind of don\\'t want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?\\nChandler: I\\'d love to, but it\\'s 2300 hours and I\\'m about to have the most organized sex anyone\\'s ever had.\\nJoey: Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.\\nRoss: Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-13\\nWritten by: Sherry Bilding-Graham & Ellen Plummer     Produced by: Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller    Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa\\nPhoebe: Hi\\nAll: Hey!

Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...\\nJoey: Oh, you know what you should do?

This baby\\'d better to be really good.\\nRachel:  Oh, uhm, excuse me, I\\'m here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.\\nRoss: And I\\'m Doctor Ross Geller.\\nRachel: Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.\\nRachel: Can somebody please go in?\\nNurse: Absolutely.\\nRoss: Rach, I think I\\'m gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don\\'t want to infect him.\\nRachel: Ross, please, don\\'t be so scared of him!\\nRoss: I\\'m not scared of him, I\\'m really sick!\\nNurse: He\\'s under sedation, so he\\'s pretty much out.\\nRoss: I\\'m feeling better.\\nRachel: Oh!  Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?\\nNurse: Miss Green, your father\\'s doctor is on the phone if you\\'d like to speak to him.\\nRachel: Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?\\nRoss: He\\'s unconscious, I think we\\'ll be just fine!\\nRachel : Ok.\\nRoss: Did the TV wake you?\\nDr. Green: No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.\\nRoss: Ouchy.\\nDr. Green: What are you doing here, Geller?\\nRoss: Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second!  So what\\'s new?\\nDr. Green: Ooh, I have a little heart attack.\\nRoss: Right, is it painful?\\nDr. Green: What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?\\nRoss  Let\\'s see if we can get that Rachel back here.\\nDr. Green: So what\\'s new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?\\nRoss: Nope, just the one. RACH!\\nPhoebe: Je m\\'appelle Claude.\\nJoey: Je do call blue!\\nPhoebe: Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let\\'s try at one syllable at a time. Ok?

Pooh.\\nRoss: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nRoss: I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad\\'s fridge was bacon and heavy cream.

Emma\\'s doing great.\\nRachel: Oh good.\\nRoss: Wow.\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss: Just can\\'t believe I\\'m in Rachel Green\\'s room.\\nRachel: What do you mean?

I should go to the hospital!\\nRoss: What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss: They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn\\'t even know if you were there. Look, we\\'ll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?\\nRachel: Really, I shouldn\\'t feel guilty?\\nRoss: No, God! Hey, Rach, you\\'ve been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.\\nRachel: Ok, maybe you\\'re right.\\nRoss:  Good night.\\nRachel: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?\\nRoss: Sure!\\nRachel: Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today.\\nRoss: Oh, of course...\\nRachel: Rachel Green is very happy you\\'re in her room!\\nRoss: Me too. Come here.\\nRachel: I just don\\'t want to be alone tonight.\\nRoss: Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or.... No, Rach! I\\'m sorry, I just don\\'t think this, this, this is a good idea.\\nRachel: Wait, we won\\'t know that until we do it, will we?\\nRoss: No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you\\'re feeling vulnerable and I just don\\'t feel it would be right, I\\'d feel like I\\'d be, you know, taking advantage of you.\\nRachel: Taking advantage? I\\'m giving you the advantage, enjoy!\\nRoss: Look, I\\'m sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I\\'m gonna go!\\nRachel: Wow. Ok.\\nRoss: I\\'ll see you in the morning .\\nRachel: Mhm-mh!\\nRoss:  Haven\\'t had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!\\nErica: Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.\\nMonica: Oh, I\\'m glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.\\nChandler:  New York is awesome!\\nMonica: What is with you?\\nChandler: Yeah, I\\'ve been to these places before, but I\\'ve never really seen them, you know.\\nMonica: Yeah, you miss alot, when you\\'re moo-ing.\\nErica: Thanks so much for showing me around.\\nMonica: Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.\\nErica: Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...\\nChandler: Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?\\nErica: Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.\\nChandler: That\\'s great.\\nErica: Yeah... it\\'s almost definitely him.\\nMonica: How\\'s that now?\\nErica: Well, there is a chance it\\'s another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.\\nChandler: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?\\nErica: No, he\\'s in prison.\\nMonica: Was he falsely accused of something?\\nErica: No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he\\'s a great guy.\\nChandler: I\\'ll bet his dad doesn\\'t think so.\\nMonica: Are you awake?\\nChandler: Of course I\\'m awake. Assume from now on that I\\'m always awake!\\nMonica: Alright, we don\\'t know that it\\'s him. I mean, it could be the football guy.\\nChandler: Honey, it\\'s us. Of course it\\'s the shovel-killer.\\nMonica: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?\\nChandler: I\\'d keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.\\nMonica: How?\\nChandler: I dunno, aren\\'t there tests for these things, right?\\nMonica: Yeah, but maybe we\\'re just over-reacting.\\nChandler: Pff, easy for you to say, he\\'s a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He\\'s probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!\\nTape: We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.\\nJoey: Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!\\nTape: Good job.\\nJoey: Thank you.\\nPhoebe: Hey Joey.\\nJoey: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.\\nJoey: Oh, no, that\\'s okay, I don\\'t need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!\\nPhoebe: Really, can I hear some of it.\\nJoey: Sure, sure. Ok,  See?\\nPhoebe: Well, you\\'re not,  You\\'re not... you\\'re not... again, you\\'re not SPEAKING FRENCH!\\nJoey:  Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I\\'m definitely gonna get the part.\\nPhoebe: How could you possibly think that?\\nJoey: For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!\\nRoss: Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?\\nRachel:\\nRoss: You\\'ve been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?\\nRachel: Hmm-hmm.\\nRoss: You sure you\\'re alright?\\nRachel:  Yep.\\nRoss:\\nRachel: FYI..\\nRoss:\\nRachel: In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.\\nRoss:  You\\'re mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.\\nRachel:  Really? Well, it seems to me if you\\'d done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!\\nRoss:  Well...\\nRachel: Oh stop that!\\nRoss: I can\\'t believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.\\nRachel:\\nRoss: Hey, I was looking out for you.\\nRachel: Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don\\'t need someone telling me what is best for me.\\nRoss: I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.\\nRachel: Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn\\'t very good for me either.\\nRoss: Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let\\'s just say, you and me, never having sex again.\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss: That\\'s right, sex is off the table.\\nChandler: Hey! How was lunch?\\nErica:\\nChandler:  Oh, really?\\nErica: No!  You we\\'re right, that was fun! I\\'m gonna go finish packing.\\nChandler: O-okay.  So, is she gonna take the test?\\nMonica: Nope, she doesn\\'t have to, I found out who the father is.\\nChandler: Oh God. It\\'s shovely-Joe, isn\\'t it?\\nMonica:  No it\\'s not.\\nChandler: How do you know?\\nErica: Well, it turns out that Erica didn\\'t pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it\\'d be pretty hard to make a baby that way.\\nChandler: Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?\\nMonica: The thing we never do.\\nChandler:  Shovely Joe!\\nDirector: Whenever you\\'re ready Joey.\\nJoey: Right.  Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c\\'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.\\nCasting assistant: I\\'m sorry, what\\'s going on?\\nJoey: Dude, come on!

Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say \"thank you\" for coming with me.\\nRoss: Oh, no problem.\\nRachel: And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it\\'s probably not a great idea to go down that road again.\\nRoss: Thank you. I\\'m glad you agree.\\nRachel: It\\'s a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.\\nRoss: Yeah... Yeah, that\\'s true.\\nRachel: Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?\\nRoss: Oh, ye-ah!\\nRachel: You know it was you\\'re uhm... birthday...\\nRoss: ...Valentine\\'s day...\\nBoth:  Oh yeah!\\nRachel: Well, I guess that\\'s all in the past, now.\\nRoss: Hmmm-mmmm.\\nRachel:  Not even one more time?\\nRoss: Not even once.\\nRachel: No matter how much we want it.\\nRoss: Even if we want it really bad.\\nRachel: That\\'s what we decided.\\nRoss: Uhm, right!\\nRachel: ...It\\'s kinda hard though!\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nRachel: You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that\\'s... just seems like such a... waste.\\nRoss: ...I hate waste.\\nRachel: ...Ross?\\nRoss: Yes?\\nRachel: Just so you know... With us... it\\'s never off the table.\\nRoss: Damn it. It\\'s never off the table.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nPhoebe: Okay, can you really tapdance?\\nJoey: No.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s off the resum.\\nPhoebe: Archery?\\nJoey: No.\\nPhoebe: Horseback riding?\\nJoey: Would fall off a lot.\\nPhoebe: You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?\\nJoey: That I can do.\\nPhoebe: Come on!

Yeah, this is fun, couples night.\\nChandler: Yeah, I don\\'t know why we hang out with married couples more often.\\nMonica: Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.\\nChandler: You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn\\'t have done it.\\nRoss:  Hey, you guys... I have great news.\\nMonica: Ross, we\\'re kind of in the middle of diner here.\\nRoss: Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today...\\nChandler: A dinosaur died a million years ago?\\nRoss: Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh....

I am gonna get laid.\\nRachel:  Hi you guys.\\nAll: Hey.\\nRachel: Ooh, Italian!\\nMonica: No one wanted seconds, right?\\nRoss: No, no. I-I\\'m good.\\nRachel: Hey you guys... You\\'re never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.\\nRoss: I\\'m up for tenure.\\nRachel: Congratulations!\\nRoss: You too! What are the odds?\\nRachel: Ooh!\\nJoey:  I finally got that seed out of my teeth.\\nMonica: I don\\'t know who I\\'m happiest for...\\nPhoebe: I do, he\\'s been working on that all day!\\nOPENING CREDITS\\nPhoebe: Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?\\nMonica: No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.\\nPhoebe: Where did you go to do it?\\nMonica: Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...\\nChandler: YOU NEVER DID IT!\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just the idea of being an official Bing.\\nChandler: Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let\\'s call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.\\nMike:  Here you go.\\nPhoebe: Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?\\nMike: Oh, it\\'s just... It\\'s up to you.

You\\'ll see how close it is to the city.\\nJoey: But no, it\\'s not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn\\'t even find it on the map.\\nMonica: Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.\\nJoey: You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!\\nChandler: Damn it.\\nMonica: See you guys later.\\nPhoebe: Okay!\\nMonica:  I\\'ll pick you up at eleven. So glad you\\'re coming.\\nPhoebe: Good for you. That was really mature.\\nJoey: What? No, the only reason  I\\'m going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that\\'s wrong with it, so they don\\'t move. I\\'m gonna make them stay here.\\nMike: You\\'re a strange kind of grown-up.\\nPhoebe: Joey, you can\\'t make someone do something they don\\'t want to do. Believe me, there\\'s something I\\'ve been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there\\'s... he\\'s just...\\nMike: Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?\\nPhoebe: All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.\\nJoey: Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that \"thing\". What is it?\\nJoey: I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!\\nRachel:  Hi, I\\'m here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It\\'s spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.\\nMaitre d\\': Mr Campbell\\'s not here yet. Let me show you to his table.\\nRachel: Oh my God! That\\'s my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.\\nMaitre d\\': I\\'m sorry. That\\'s always mr Campbell\\'s table.\\nRachel: But my... but my boss cannot see me.

I\\'m on a date...\\nMr Zellner:  That\\'s great!\\nRachel: Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it\\'s tough. Single mom, career...

Excuse us.\\nMr Campbell: Please...\\nRachel: Okay. Oh, yeah...  Oh he\\'s cute!\\nMr Campbell: So... your resum is quite impressive.\\nRachel: Wha... My resum? I wouldn\\'t... I wouldn\\'t call my online dating profile a resum.\\nMr Campbell: Dating profile? I-I-I\\'m talking about the work resum.\\nRachel:  Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason? Huh?\\nMr Campbell: Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?\\nRachel: What? I-I don\\'t.\\nMr Campbell: You don\\'t?\\nRachel: No, I-I-I love it there.\\nMr Campbell: Well, if you don\\'t want to leave, why are we having this lunch?\\nMr Campbell: What?\\nMr Campbell: That\\'s Hugo Boss?\\nPhoebe:  But you obviously haven\\'t.\\nClerk: How can I help you?\\nPhoebe: I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I\\'m-I\\'m hiding from the law.  You\\'re fun.\\nClerk: You need to fill out this form.\\nPhoebe: Okay, well, I just don\\'t, I don\\'t know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband\\'s name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?\\nClerk: It can be anything you want.\\nPhoebe: Well, not anything, I mean...\\nClerk: Yeah... anything.\\nPhoebe: Oh, this could take a while.\\nClerk: Get out of my line.\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey Pheebs.\\nPhoebe: Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.\\nMonica: Oh, I\\'m sorry, mrs Hannigan.\\nPhoebe: Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here\\'s an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.\\nChandler: That\\'s what we were gonna name the baby.\\nMonica: Phoebe!\\nPhoebe: Uh! Princess Consuela.\\nMonica: You seriously changed your name to that?\\nPhoebe: Uh-huh!\\nMonica: Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?\\nPhoebe: Uhm, no. I\\'m gonna have my friends call me Valerie.\\nChandler: Hey, how\\'d the interview go?\\nRachel: Oh! It\\'s not good.\\nChandler: You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I\\'ll bet it went better than you think.\\nRachel: Well, I didn\\'t get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.\\nChandler: That is a bad interview.\\nPhoebe: What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?\\nRachel: Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he\\'s gonna have to let me go, because I\\'m not a team player. And I said \"Wait a minute! Yes I am.\" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.\\nMonica: Oh God. I\\'m so sorry.\\nRoss: Hey! Wha-hoo! What\\'s this?  Well it\\'s a, it\\'s a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?\\nPhoebe: Ross...\\nRoss: I guess it\\'s here because I GOT TENURE!\\nAll\\nRoss: This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!\\nGunther: Six? You want me to join you?\\nRoss: Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I\\'m gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.\\nChandler: Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it\\'s vanilla!\\nRoss: I got tenure. I didn\\'t win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?\\nRachel: Oh it... good! Yeah, but I\\'m not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.\\nRoss: Oh, you know what? You\\'re gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.\\nPhoebe: Can you?\\nRachel: Ah, all right. Here\\'s to Ross!\\nRoss: And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.\\nPhoebe: And to knowing that your career doesn\\'t mean everything.\\nRoss: But also knowing it means a lot.\\nMonica: But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.\\nRoss: ...that center around work.\\nChandler: To Ross!\\nAll : Ross!\\nRoss: You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.\\nPhoebe: Oh God!\\nRoss: No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look  how happy you are for me.\\nRachel:  No, it\\'s not that. I got fired today. And I didn\\'t get the other job.\\nRoss: Rach, I\\'m so sorry.\\nRachel: Oh!\\nRoss: Great. I feel like an idiot.\\nRachel: No, it\\'s okay, you didn\\'t know.\\nRoss: Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.\\nMonica: Thank you for letting us see the house again.\\nChandler: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I\\'ve already forgotten what you said, but thank you.\\nRealtor: Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you\\'re through.\\nMonica: Ah, so glad you decided to come.\\nJoey: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I\\'m so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.\\nChandler: What?\\nJoey: Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.\\nMonica: No it\\'s not. We had an inspection and they didn\\'t find anything.\\nJoey: Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.\\nMonica: Maybe because it\\'s you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.\\nJoey: Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it\\'s pretty dark.\\nMonica: No it\\'s not!\\nJoey:  Are you kiddin\\'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!\\nChandler: When your head was hanging out the window, it didn\\'t hit a mailbox, did it?\\nJoey:  Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.\\nMonica: Oh Joey, look, we know you\\'re having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.\\nJoey: FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...\\nMonica: Joey, we know that\\'s you.\\nJoey: no... hmmmmm... it\\'s not... hmmmmmmmmmm\\nMike: Hey\\nPhoebe: Welcome back!\\nMike: Ah! I missed you\\nPhoebe: Oh, me too!\\nMike: So, what\\'s new?\\nPhoebe: Well, I\\'m no longer Phoebe Buffay.\\nMike: That\\'s great! You changed you name?\\nPhoebe: Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!\\nMike:  You\\'re kidding right?\\nPhoebe: Nope.\\nMike: You really did that?\\nPhoebe: Yep.\\nMike: Yeah, but you can\\'t do that.\\nPhoebe: Why? It\\'s fun, it\\'s different, no-one else has a name like it.\\nMike:  Alright, then I\\'m gonna change my name.\\nPhoebe: Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?\\nMike: Crap Bag.\\nPhoebe: Mike Crap Bag?\\nMike: No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.\\nPhoebe: You\\'re not serious, right?\\nMike: Yeah, I\\'m serious.  It\\'s fun, it\\'s different and no-one else has a name like that!\\nPhoebe: Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.\\nMike: I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.\\nPhoebe: And I love Crap.\\nJoey:  Ow!\\nGirl: Who are you?\\nJoey: Oh, hi, I\\'m Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?\\nGirl: I\\'m Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.\\nJoey:  Oh.\\nMackenzie:  I hate my parents.\\nJoey: I hate my friends.  Alright, look. There\\'s gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.\\nMackenzie: Like what?\\nJoey:  Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!\\nMackenzie: What are you? Eight?\\nJoey: Woah, uh! Okay, let\\'s hear your great idea.\\nMackenzie: I don\\'t have any great ideas. I am eight.\\nJoey:  Ahh! There\\'s gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?\\nMackenzie: I really don\\'t.\\nJoey: What am I gonna do, I feel like I\\'m losing my friends.\\nMackenzie: My parents say I\\'m gonna make new friends.\\nJoey: Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you\\'re young. Me, I\\'m set in my ways.\\nMackenzie: This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners.  Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?\\nJoey: Yeah, yeah, I guess.\\nMackenzie: Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don\\'t you want them to do it?\\nJoey:  Yeah, maybe.\\nMackenzie: Then you gotta let them go.\\nJoey:  I hate to admit it, but you\\'re probably right. How did you get to be so smart?\\nMackenzie: I read a lot.\\nJoey:\\nMan: Hey Rach, I just heard. I\\'m so sorry.\\nRachel: Oh, thank you...\\nMan: You still don\\'t know my name, do you?\\nRachel:\\nRachel:  Ross, what is taking you so long?\\nRoss:  I\\'m sorry, it\\'s almost as if this wasn\\'t built for a quick getaway!\\nMark: Rachel?\\nRachel:\\nMark: How\\'ve you been?\\nRachel: I\\'m fantastic. You remember Ross?\\nMark: Sure, sure.\\nRoss: Uh, you know, you can\\'t always get a seat on the subway, so...\\nMark: Clever.  So how are you?\\nRachel: Oh, well,  you\\'re not catching me on my best day.\\nMark: Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn\\'t exactly say big promotion.\\nRachel: No, but it\\'s good, you know, I\\'m gonna take some time off and do some charity work.\\nMark: Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.\\nRachel: Well, screw charity work. What\\'ve you got?\\nMark: Why don\\'t we have dinner tonight and talk about it?\\nRachel: Great! I\\'ll call ya!\\nMark:  Nice to see you.\\nRoss: Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!\\nRachel:  Oh my God!\\nRoss: See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I\\'ve met him before?\\nRachel: Ross! That\\'s Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.\\nRoss:  That is Mark?\\nRachel: Yes.\\nRoss: I hate that guy.\\nRachel: Oh.\\nRoss: No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.\\nRachel: What? You don\\'t want me to get a job?\\nRoss: Oh yeah, I\\'m sure he\\'s gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.\\nRachel: Ugh.\\nRoss: I\\'m serious. I just don\\'t trust that guy, okay?\\nRachel: Ross, you know what?\\nMonica: Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.\\nChandler: Man, those two dogs are going at it!\\nJoey:  Hey!\\nChandler: Hey.\\nMonica: Hey, where have you been?\\nJoey: Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.\\nChandler: Really? What changed your mind?\\nJoey: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.\\nChandler: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.\\nJoey:  What?\\nChandler: Ha! I\\'m just messing with you.\\nJoey: That\\'s not funny! You know I\\'m afraid of little girl ghosts!\\nMonica: Joey, now that you\\'re okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?\\nJoey: What? I get my own room?\\nChandler: You don\\'t think we\\'d buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?\\nJoey: Oh my God!  Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?\\nChandler and Monica: No!\\nJoey: Why not? I\\'ll keep the tank clean.\\nMike: After you, miss Banana Hammock.\\nPhoebe: Thank you, mister Bag.\\nWoman: Oh hey, how are you?\\nPhoebe: Oh hi Rita! Good!  Oh, Rita\\'s a massage client.\\nMike: Oh! Why don\\'t you introduce me?\\nPhoebe:  Er, Rita, this is my husband.\\nRita: Oh!\\nPhoebe: Yeah.\\nMike: Why don\\'t you tell her my name?\\nPhoebe:  This is my husband Crap Bag.\\nRita: Crap Bag?\\nMike: If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.\\nRita: Okay. Excuse me...\\nPhoebe: Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?\\nMike: Only if you\\'ll be Phoebe Buffay.\\nPhoebe: How about uhm...

Why? Who\\'s she with?\\nRoss: That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale\\'s... She thinks he\\'s just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.\\nChandler: It\\'s seven years ago.  My time machine works!\\nRoss: We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.\\nMonica: So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she\\'s single and he\\'s cute.\\nChandler: Excuse me?\\nMonica: Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn\\'t stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.\\nChandler: For your information, I was staring at her baby. We\\'re about to be parents.\\nMonica: Oh, sorry!\\nRachel:  Hi you guys!\\nRoss: Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?\\nRachel: Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.\\nRoss:  Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?\\nRachel: Oh Ross, come on. He\\'s happily married. His wife just had twins.\\nRoss: Should we send something?\\nChandler: How did the job stuff go?\\nRachel: He offered me one.\\nChandler: That\\'s great!\\nRoss: Congratulations!\\nRachel: I know, it\\'s amazing. It\\'s amazing. It\\'s so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...\\nRoss: Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn\\'t believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.\\nRachel: The job is in Paris.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nJoey: I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I\\'ve always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?\\nMackenzie:\\nJoey: Hey bear, I need some career advice.\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-15\\nTeleplay by: Tracy Reilly    Written by: Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen     Produced by: Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Sebastiano & Vanessa\\nJennifer: Previously on Friends...\\nChandler: How did the job stuff go?\\nRachel: He offered me one.\\nRoss:  You know what?

Please, somebody  say something.\\nRoss: So if you take this job you\\'ll be moving to Paris?\\nChandler: Or facing a bitch of a commute.\\nRachel: I know, it\\'s huge, and it\\'s scary, and it\\'s... really far, far away    from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I\\'ve already    talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they\\'ll do whatever    we need to make us feel comfortable.\\nRoss: Okay.\\nRachel: I mean, I\\'ll fly back and forth, they\\'ll fly you out...    Anything we want.\\nChandler: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.\\nRoss: All right, we\\'ll work it out.\\nRachel: Thank you! Thank you!\\nRoss: Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?\\nRachel: I think it is.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, what\\'s going on?\\nRachel: I got a really incredible job offer.\\nJoey: Hey, great!

I wouldn\\'t trust it.\\nRachel: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means    a lot if you could try to get on board.\\nPhoebe: Of course we can. Congratulations.  Joey...\\nJoey: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.\\nRachel:  Joey, it would mean so...\\nJoey: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.\\nRachel: Joey...\\nPhoebe: You okay with this?\\nChandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...\\nPhoebe: Talking to Ross.\\nChandler: I see.\\nRoss: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every    day. How can I be okay with this?\\nMonica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.\\nRoss: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,    she would take it?\\nMonica: How is that gonna happen?\\nChandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas    party. We really hit it off.\\nMonica: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?\\nRoss: I didn\\'t say we were brothers.\\n   OPENING CREDITS\\nMonica: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next    door to the one that we\\'re buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna    take a look at it, but Chandler doesn\\'t.\\nChandler: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse    us, and we\\'re easily confused. We\\'re not very bright.\\nMonica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?\\nChandler: What do you think Pheebs?\\nPhoebe: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin    Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn\\'t Joey\\'s agent Estelle Leonard?\\nChandler: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: She died.\\nChandler: You\\'re kidding!\\nMonica: That\\'s terrible!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across    the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the    wrong one.\\nChandler: Oh yeah?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, she was just an agent.\\nMonica: Joey\\'s gonna be *so* upset.\\nChandler: I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    Atlantic.\\nPhoebe: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He\\'s already flipping out about    everything that\\'s changing. This will push him over the edge.\\nMonica: Seriously, you don\\'t think we should tell him?\\nPhoebe: Well, not for a little while. Let\\'s just give him a few days to get    used to everything else.\\nMonica: What if he reads it in the paper?\\nChandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we\\'re okay.\\nRoss: Yeah, I\\'m a friend of Rachel Green\\'s. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas    party about two years ago.\\nMr Zelner: Oh right, uhm, Don?\\nRoss: Close. Ron.\\nMr Zelner: Uh... What can I do for you?\\nRoss: Uhm, well... I\\'m here to see if you\\'ll give Rachel her job back.\\nMr Zelner: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?\\nRoss: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we\\'ll    see if she wants to come back.\\nMr Zelner: Wow, that is tempting.\\nRoss: Look, she loved her job here. And let\\'s face    it: you\\'re not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn\\'t that    true?\\nMr Zelner: She is good!\\nRoss:  Huh, I took a shot there.\\nMr Zelner: But I\\'m sorry. There\\'s nothing I can do... Ah,    it\\'s not true, there is... nothing I want to do.\\nRoss: I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?\\nMr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross.  What?\\nRoss: Oh, nothing, its just, its close to Ron. Does he.. Does    little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?\\nMr Zelner: Yeah, they\\'re all he talks about, why?\\nRoss: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after    everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.    . I just heard it as you must have heard it and thats    not good. Let me start again. Im a paleontologist, youll be there    with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils!\\nMr Zelner: You can really arrange that?\\nRoss: You let Rachel come back, and its done.\\nMr Zelner: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing    in the world.\\nRoss: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life.\\nMr Zelner: Thats great. I worry about little Ross. Hes always    reading, he\\'s collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs.\\nRoss: Hell be fine.\\nJoey: Hey Phoebe.\\nPhoebe: Hey. Everything ok?\\nJoey: Im just mad at my agent.\\nPhoebe: Estelle? Why?\\nJoey: Theres a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didnt even be put up for it! Shed better have a good reason.\\nPhoebe: Im guessing she does.\\n  Joey: Well  Im wanna hear it,    because she keeps doing this.\\nPhoebe: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her.\\nJoey: Ok. Why?\\nPhoebe: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.\\nJoey: I love that saying!\\nJoey: Hello?\\nPhoebe : Joey, its Estelle.\\nJoey: I was just gonna call you! Thats weird.\\nPhoebe-Estelle: Its a little coincidental, but believable.    . Listen, Im sure youre wondering why    I didnt get you an audition for that TV movie.\\nJoey: Yeah, actually I am!\\nPhoebe-Estelle: I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!\\nJoey: Thats it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.\\nPhoebe-Estelle: Dont take that tone with me. Who you    think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?\\nJoey: No, no, look. All Im saying is that youre my agent, ok?    And youre not getting me into any auditions and Im tired of it.\\nPhoebe-Estelle: What are you saying?\\nJoey: Im saying that .\\nPhoebe: Man, tough week for Estelle!\\nRoss: Hi.\\nRachel: Hi.\\nRoss: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she cant sleep    without it.\\nRachel: Oh, well, shes asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.\\nRoss: Ok.\\nRachel: Oh, youre not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph    Lauren called, and gave me my job back!\\nRoss: Nooo!\\nRachel: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out    of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling    apart without me.\\nRoss: So, youre not going to Paris.\\nRachel: No, Im still going.\\nRoss: Wh whwhat?\\nRachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,    the offered me more money! Isnt that great?\\nRoss: Yeeeah!\\nLady: Oh, sure. Im showing it to someone else right now,    but please, look around.\\nMonica: Thanks.\\nChandler: It feels like were cheating on our house.    And if were gonna cheat, shouldnt it be with like a hot, younger house,    that does stuff that our house wont do?\\nMonica: Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks    like a cave! What a hole!\\nLady: So? What do you think?\\nMonica: Love it!\\nLady: Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady    upstairs is goning to make another one.\\nMonica: They could be our neighbors, what are they like?\\nLady: Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids,    he\\'s on Wall Street and she\\nJanice: Oh my God!\\nChandler : Sure.\\nPhoebe: Hey Joey, want come with me to are you ok?\\nJoey: Yeah, I just I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be    killing her.\\nPhoebe: No, that wouldnt kill her. Ordinary embolism might.\\nJoey: I dont know. Shes got to be taking it hard, I was like    her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And Im guessing    he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know shes not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. Im gonna call her and hire her again.\\nPhoebe: No, no, no! Don\\'t call her! You wait for her to call    you\\nJoey: Why?\\nPhoebe: Because patience is the road to understanding  which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.\\nJoey:  You blow me away.\\nPhoebe:  All right, so promise you\\'re gonna wait for her    to call you?\\nJoey: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.\\nChandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce!\\nRealtor: You two know each other?\\nJanice: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man    out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin!\\nChandler:\\nMonica: No, actually, we\\'re buying the house next door.\\nChandler:  Why!?\\nMonica:  I don\\'t know    why.\\nJanice: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence.    But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to    get it!\\nChandler: This can not be happening!\\nMonica: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.    Maybe the Janice\\'s won\\'t get it! Maybe the other couple will.\\nChandler: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the Hitlers.\\nMonica:     All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house    into a guest house.\\nChandler: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don\\'t mean to sound distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money!?\\nMonica: Okay, you come up with an idea.\\nChandler: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house. We can still get out.\\nMonica: But we love our house.\\nChandler: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she\\'s gonna be louder    out here too. Just the crickets and  \"Oh My God\"!\\nMonica: Okay, but if we don\\'t get this house, she\\'s stil gonna show up wherever    we go! I mean, at least if she\\'s here, it eliminates the element of suprise.    I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls    jump back up inside your body.\\nChandler:\\nr Zelner: Who is it?\\nRoss:     Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might    be able to get her to come back.\\nMr Zelner: This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees,    is not my main job.\\nRoss: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?\\nMr Zelner:  Not good, Ron.\\nRoss: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  replica.\\nMr Zelner:\\nRoss: Huh? So? We have a deal?\\nMr Zelner: Okay, you got it.\\nRoss: Yes! yes!\\nMr Zelner: This is gonna make me very popular.\\nRoss: Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!\\nMr Zelner:  I meant with my son.\\nRoss: Good, \\'cause the ladies, not so much.\\nJoey: Oh my God.  Hello?\\nPhoebe:\\nJoey: Estelle?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there\\'s no hard feelings for    firing me.\\nJoey:  Ok-ay. I just, I can\\'t believe you\\'re calling me?\\nPhoebe: Well, I didn\\'t think I should just drop by...\\nJoey: No, no, no!  Don\\'t drop by,    don\\'t drop by!\\nPhoebe: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I\\'m okay.\\nJoey: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what\\'s it like there?\\nPhoebe:  It\\'s alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with    the career. You\\'re gonna be huge.\\nJoey: Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.     \"out of area\". Boy, I\\'ll say.\\nChandler: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.\\nJanice: All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I\\'ll see    you later, neighbor.\\nChandler: Wait! I just want you to know that... I\\'m so happy you\\'re going to    be here.\\nJanice: Oh, me too...\\nChandler: Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.\\nJanice: Huh?\\nChandler: I never stopped loving you.\\nJanice: Oh... my...\\nChandler: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice    Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.\\nJanice: Chandler, what are you talking about?\\nChandler: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and    Monica never have to know a thing.\\nJanice: I don\\'t know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this...    heat between us.\\nChandler:  Obviously.\\nJanice: But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don\\'t    think we should get this house now.\\nChandler: Don\\'t say that. Don\\'t tangle the dream and take it away.\\nJanice: Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.\\nChandler: I understand.\\nJanice: Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...\\nChandler:  They\\'re never coming down now.\\nRachel: Hi!\\nRoss: Hey!\\nRachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.\\nRoss: What?\\nRachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered    me more money.\\nRoss: They did?\\nRachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we\\'ll    do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I    don\\'t even know what department that guy\\'s in.\\nRoss: So, what are you gonna do?\\nRachel: Well, I took it.\\nRoss: That\\'s great! So you\\'re staying in New York!\\nBoth: YAY! WHOO! YAY!\\nRoss: You\\'re excited, right?\\nRachel:  Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money\\'s great.    It\\'s certainly the easier choice...\\nRoss: Right!\\nRachel: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to    Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital    of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it\\'s    fine. I\\'m fine going back to a job where I\\'ve pretty much gotten everything out of    that I possibly can...\\nRoss: Uhm, I hadn\\'t no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.    Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.\\nRachel: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when    I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared...    But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.\\nRoss:  You should go.\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss: It\\'s what you want. You should go.\\nRachel: You really think so?\\nRoss: I really do.\\nRachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...\\nRoss:  I\\'m sure he\\'ll    understand.\\nRachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! I\\'m gonna do it. I\\'m gonna go to Paris.\\nRoss: Yeah...\\nRachel: Yeah! I\\'m going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!\\nRoss: Yeah, yeah, oh!\\nRachel: Oh! Oh, I\\'m so happy.\\nRoss: Then I\\'m happy too.\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\nJoey: Thank you all for coming. We\\'re here today to pay respects    to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...\\nTHE END\\n======== 10-16\\nWritten by: Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen   Produced by: Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller    Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa   Final check by Kim\\nJoey: All right, all right, all right, let\\'s play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.\\nRachel: Ok! Can\\'t believe I\\'m risking  this again, but you\\'re on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.\\nJoey: Just flip!\\nRachel : Ha, tails!\\nJoey: Damnit!\\nChandler: Hey!\\nJoey: Hey!\\nChandler: So we thought we\\'d throw you little going away party around seven.\\nRachel: Oh, that sounds good!\\nMonica: Hey, Rach, you\\'re leaving tomorrow, shouldn\\'t you be packing?\\nRachel: It\\'s all done!\\nMonica: Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.\\nRachel: I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I\\'m taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma\\'s Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I\\'m having shipped, and that\\'s the sandwich that I made for the plane...\\nMonica: Ok,  so you\\'ve done some good work!  What about your carry-ons?\\nRachel: Oh, well. Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.\\nMonica: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!\\nChandler: Where\\'s your passport?\\nRachel: It should be right next to my plane ticket.\\nChandler: Well, it\\'s not.\\nRachel: What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it\\'s not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!\\nMonica: Here, let me help you.\\nRachel: Shoot. Oh, I can\\'t believe I did this!\\nChandler : At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?\\nOPENING SEQUENCE\\nMonica: Oh, wow, can you believe you\\'re like three weeks away?\\nErica: I know.\\nMonica: You don\\'t mind me touching your belly, do you?\\nErica: No, I don\\'t mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.\\nRoss: Hey!\\nErica: Hi.\\nRoss: Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you\\'ve gotten.\\nErica: That\\'s because I\\'m pregnant!\\nRoss: Right, no, I understand.\\nErica: Oh, ok.  I\\'m just always afraid that people think I\\'m just fat with big breasts.\\nRoss: No, no, I knew .\\nMonica : Okay, well, stop staring at them.\\nRoss: She brought them up!  I didn\\'t realize you were coming back so soon!\\nErica: Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won\\'t be able to travel.\\nMonica: Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.\\nRoss: Hotel? Why isn\\'t she staying with you guys?\\nMonica: Because we\\'re moving in a couple of days and it just didn\\'t make sense.\\nErica: Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!\\nRoss: Erica, those things aren\\'t free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...\\nMonica: Ross! She\\'s giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.\\nErica : I\\'ll be right back.\\nRoss: Oh man, I can\\'t believe you guys are leaving this place.\\nMonica: Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana\\'s name.\\nRoss: No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost  to feed Joey?\\nMonica: Yeah, it takes two incomes.\\nRoss: Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.\\nMonica: Oh, no. He doesn\\'t have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.\\nRoss: Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.\\nMonica: Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.\\nRoss: What are you guys doing?\\nJoey: Try it, I can\\'t feel a thing!\\nMonica : Are, are you kidding? This is packing?\\nChandler: We\\'re taking a break!\\nMonica: From?\\nChandler: Jumping on the bed?\\nMonica: All right, Rachel\\'s party is in a couple of hours and there\\'s a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you\\'re in charge of these yahoos!\\nRoss: You got it!  Let\\'s put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!\\nChandler: No, no, no, guys. She\\'s right. We should get to work. I\\'ll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack \\'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.\\nJoey: You guys hear a ringing?\\nChandler:  What the hell is this?\\nJoey: Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn\\'t know you guys had it in ya!\\nRoss: Chandler, you don\\'t have a sister so you can\\'t understand how much this bums me out.\\nChandler: I didn\\'t know Monica had these!\\nJoey: Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!\\nChandler: Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!\\nRoss: Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nMonica: Hey! Where\\'s Mike?\\nPhoebe: Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.\\nRoss: Yeah? Yeah, where is it?\\nPhoebe: Oh, he\\'s playing organ for a children\\'s roller-skating party.\\nRoss: Rock on!\\nPhoebe  What is all this stuff?\\nMonica: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don\\'t want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.\\nJoey:  Hey.\\nChandler: Hey.\\nRoss: Hey, where\\'s Rach?\\nJoey: Oh, she\\'s putting Emma down, she\\'ll be over in a second.\\nRoss: Great.\\nJoey: Now it just hit her that she\\'s leaving and she\\'s kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nEverybody: Hey Rach, hey you.\\nRoss: Here she is!\\nRachel : Hi you guys!\\nJoey: What did I just say?\\nRachel: No, no, no. It\\'s ok. I\\'m gonna be fine.\\nMonica: Come here, I\\'ll make you a drink.\\nRoss: Oh, man! I can\\'t believe she\\'s actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?\\nChandler: I know, she\\'s been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!\\nJoey : You know, I had a chance to stop her too!\\nRoss: Yeah?\\nJoey: Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute...\\nChandler: Yes, Joe?\\nJoey: I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!\\nPhoebe : You doing ok?\\nRachel: Well, I\\'ve been better.\\nPhoebe: Uh-hmm.\\nRachel: You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?\\nPhoebe: Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!\\nRachel: I\\'m gonna miss you so much.\\nPhoebe: I know.\\nRachel: You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .\\nRoss: Hey, what do you think they\\'re doing in there?\\nJoey: Huh, if I had to  guess I\\'d say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.\\nRachel: Oh, Pheebs, I don\\'t even know where to start.\\nPhoebe: Ok well, before you do, I know we weren\\'t supposed to get you going away presents,   but I do have something for you.\\nRachel: Oh, oh. . What is this?\\nPhoebe: It\\'s a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!\\nRachel: I\\'m gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!\\nMonica: Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.\\nChandler: Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!\\nMonica: What are you talking about? These aren\\'t mine.\\nChandler: Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!\\nMonica: That would be a terrible punishment. But, I\\'m serious, I\\'ve never seen these before.\\nChandler: Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?\\nMonica: Rachel used to live in that room.\\nChandler: Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!\\nMonica: Joey\\'s bare ass!\\nChandler: . Well played.\\nRachel: I love you Phoebe.\\nPhoebe: I love you too.\\nRachel: All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I\\'d better keep going.\\nPhoebe: Ok.\\nRachel: Ok. Monica?\\nMonica: Yeah?\\nRachel: Can you come here with me for a minute?\\nMonica: Sure.\\nPhoebe:  Are you wearing waterproof mascara?\\nMonica: No.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you\\'re so screwed.\\nRoss:  Hey. What was that all about?\\nPhoebe: She\\'s gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.\\nRoss: Are you kidding? Oh my God...\\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know, it\\'s gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.\\nRoss: Oh, man, I\\'m not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.\\nRachel: Mon... Okay... I\\'ve gotta... just say what it is I\\'m gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn\\'t for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...\\nMonica: I know what you mean. You\\'re like a sister to me too.\\nRachel:  I wouldn\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do without you...\\nMonica:  You\\'re the best friend I ever had.\\nRachel:\\nMonica: What?\\nRachel: I... I... I...\\nMonica: That is so sweet.\\nRoss:  Oh no, she took down Monica... And I\\'m the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won\\'t talk with me if it looks like we\\'re deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.\\nChandler: Uh, Rach?\\nRoss: Well it\\'s okay. Chandler is talking to her.\\nJoey: I really made you think about that thing uh?\\nChandler:\\nRachel:  Oh, I\\'m sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don\\'t get.\\nChandler: No, no, no... They\\'re really yours. We... found them in your old room.\\nRachel: Well, these aren\\'t mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...\\nChandler: Don\\'t say Richard! Well, if they\\'re not Monica\\'s and they\\'re not yours, then whose are they?\\nRachel: Well, I think you\\'re forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.\\nChandler: Pheebs!\\nPhoebe:  Yeah!\\nChandler: I think these are yours.\\nPhoebe: These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they\\'ll snap like a piece of licorice.\\nRachel:  Can I talk to you alone for a minute?\\nChandler: Sure.  You don\\'t really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?\\nPhoebe: Where do you think Mike really is?\\nRachel: Oh honey...\\nChandler: Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I\\'m gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I\\'m gonna miss you. And I\\'m so sad that you\\'re leaving.\\nRachel:\\nChandler: Ooh, not so tight...  I\\'m sorry, just give me one more chance.\\nRachel: Okay. Oh...\\nRachel: Oh!\\nChandler: I\\'m sor... Just go. Just go. I can\\'t, I can\\'t.\\nMonica:  So, I guess you\\'re next. You\\'re ready?\\nRoss: I don\\'t think so.\\nChandler: Oh, you\\'re definately not. I haven\\'t cried like that in years.\\nMonica: You cried yesterday at the six o\\'clock news.\\nChandler: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.\\nRoss: God! I can\\'t believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.\\nAll: No, no, no, no!\\n\\nRoss: Okay, here we go...\\nRachel: Oh...  Well...\\nRoss: Yeah...\\nRachel: I think I\\'m gonna take off.\\nRoss: Huh?\\nRachel: Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.\\nRoss: What? I don\\'t get a goodbye?\\nJoey:  Lucky bastard!\\nRoss: Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.\\nMonica: Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.\\nRoss: Well, it needs to be plicit.\\nJoey: All right, let\\'s think about this. I mean, there\\'s got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?\\nRoss: No, I don\\'t think so.\\nPhoebe: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.\\nMonica: Yeah. Mine too.\\nChandler: Mine was a humdinger\\nRoss:\\nPhoebe: Ross, if you\\'re this upset, you should go and talk to her.\\nMonica: And say what? \"You owe me a goodbye\", I mean, he\\'s got more pride than that.\\nRoss: THE HELL I DO!\\nRoss: I don\\'t get a goodbye?\\nRachel: What?\\nRoss:  Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.\\nRachel: Ross...\\nRoss: Oh no, maybe it\\'s me, I\\'m just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...\\nMonica: I hope Ross isn\\'t too upset.\\nJoey: I\\'m sure he\\'s not more bummed out than I am.\\nPhoebe: Tell me about it.\\nChandler: Well, you can\\'t say we don\\'t know how to throw a party.\\nPhoebe: All right, I think I\\'m gonna head out.\\nMonica: Uh, where do you think you\\'re going?\\nPhoebe: I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I\\'m sensing there\\'s something less fun for me to do here.\\nMonica: We\\'re moving in a couple of days and we\\'ve got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.\\nChandler: Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.\\nJoey: Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.\\nMonica: Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.\\nChandler:\\nMonica: Okay, we\\'re gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?\\nPhoebe and Joey: Yeah.\\nMonica: Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.\\nChandler: Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.\\nMonica: You did? How?\\nChandler: Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.\\nMonica: Oh my God! Let me see.\\nJoey: Who\\'s that dirty old lady?\\nChandler: Monica\\'s grandmother.\\nMonica: Nana liked it rough!\\nErica: Hi!\\nAll: Hey!\\nJoey: Come on here, have a seat.\\nPhoebe: How was your night?\\nErica: Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh...  Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.\\nMonica: Erica, are you okay?\\nErica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.\\nMonica: Oh my God!\\nChandler: Relax! We just get her some antacids.\\nMonica: She doesn\\'t have a stomach ache, she\\'s in labor.\\nChandler: Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.\\nMonica: All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let\\'s go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we\\'re gonna have a baby. All right. We\\'re gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE\\'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!\\nChandler: Honey, it\\'s gonna be okay.\\nErica: You can do this. Just breathe.\\nMonica: Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.\\nErica:  Ooh! Are you sure?\\nMonica: Oh... Yes, I\\'m sure. Oh honey, let\\'s go. Okay bye everyone.\\nJoey: Chandler, wait, wait, wait...\\nChandler: What?\\nJoey: If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.\\nRachel: You really think I didn\\'t say goodbye to you because I don\\'t care?\\nRoss: That\\'s what it seemed like.\\nRachel: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.\\nRoss: Fine, then why didn\\'t you say something?\\nRachel: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can\\'t even begin to explain to you how much I\\'m gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn\\'t say goodbye to you because you don\\'t mean as much to me as everybody else, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s because you mean more to me.
